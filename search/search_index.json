A good standard is to place the attack name, and any modifiers that effect the roll in the description. For example, here are tow attacks being modified by Inspire Courage and Frightened 2:</p>  <p>[dice=Club, Cold Iron, Strike 1, Inspire Courage, Frightened 2]1d20 + 4 + 1 -2[/dice] [dice=Bludgeoning, Inspire Courage]1d6 + 4 + 1[/dice]  [dice=Club, Cold Iron, Strike 2, Inspire Courage, Frightened 2]1d20 + 4 + 1 -2 -5[/dice] [dice=Bludgeoning, Inspire Courage]1d6 + 4 + 1[/dice] </p>  <p>This player wrote Inspire Courage in both their attack and damage roll descriptions. They also included Inspire Courage's +1 bonus, and Frightened 2's -2 penalty, separately, which added extra clarity. In the second Strike's attack roll, they also included the -5 for the Multiple Attack Penalty. </p> <p>This is excellent! Every bonus and penalty to the d20 roll is clear, and the GM can understand how each total was achieved.</p> <p>Note that the player also included the damage type in the damage roll. Including the damage type is important, as enemies often resist or are weak to certain kinds of damage. </p>"},{"location":"online-gaming/pbp/play-by-post/#reactions-and-out-of-turn-actions","title":"Reactions and Out-of-Turn Actions","text":"<p>Reactions, AOOs, and other out-of-turn activities can be tricky in play-by-post. Pre-roll reactions where applicable so the game keeps moving, and designate their trigger, on your turn. (It might help you to make a macro for this, or save text that you can copy/paste somewhere.) For example, a fighter anticipating getting an attack of opportunity on \"Bee Evil\" might write:</p>  <p>If Bee Evil moves through a square I threaten: <code>[spoiler=AOO]</code> <code>[dice=Club, Strike 1]1d20 + 2[/dice]</code>  <code>[dice=Bludgeoning, Strike 1]1d6 + 2 + 1[/dice]</code>  <code>[/spoiler]</code> </p>  <p>It is considered good form to place reactions in spoilers to keep the post efficient. At times, you may not want to other players to see your reaction\u2026 in which case the spoiler (and honor system) is a good plan. </p> <p>If you have multiple reactions, note your preference on which one you will take and what the triggers are. For example:</p>  <p>Brock has his shield raised and if Bee Evil hits him and does over 15 damage, he will use the block reaction. However, if Mook walks through a threatened square after Big Bad goes, he'll take an AOO: <code>[spoiler=AOO]</code> <code>[dice=Club, Strike 1]1d20 + 2[/dice]</code>  <code>[dice=Bludgeoning, Strike 1]1d6 + 2 + 1[/dice]</code>  <code>[/spoiler]</code> </p>  <p>GMs will generally work with the player to help keep the game flowing smoothly (for example, a defensive-oriented Champion might ask the GM to assume she shield blocks, and automatically reduce the damage for her and note her shield damage).
