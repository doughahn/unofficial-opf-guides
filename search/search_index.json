Pre-roll reactions where applicable so the game keeps moving, and designate their trigger, on your turn. (It might help you to make a macro for this, or save text that you can copy/paste somewhere.) For example, a fighter anticipating getting an attack of opportunity on \"Bee Evil\" might write:</p>  <p>If Bee Evil moves through a square I threaten: <code>[spoiler=AOO]</code> <code>[dice=Club, Strike 1]1d20 + 2[/dice]</code>  <code>[dice=Bludgeoning, Strike 1]1d6 + 2 + 1[/dice]</code>  <code>[/spoiler]</code> </p>  <p>It is considered good form to place reactions in spoilers to keep the post efficient. At times, you may not want to other players to see your reaction\u2026 in which case the spoiler (and honor system) is a good plan. </p> <p>If you have multiple reactions, note your preference on which one you will take and what the triggers are. For example:</p>  <p>Brock has his shield raised and if Bee Evil hits him and does over 15 damage, he will use the block reaction. However, if Mook walks through a threatened square after Big Bad goes, he'll take an AOO: <code>[spoiler=AOO]</code> <code>[dice=Club, Strike 1]1d20 + 2[/dice]</code>  <code>[dice=Bludgeoning, Strike 1]1d6 + 2 + 1[/dice]</code>  <code>[/spoiler]</code> </p>  <p>GMs will generally work with the player to help keep the game flowing smoothly (for example, a defensive-oriented Champion might ask the GM to assume she shield blocks, and automatically reduce the damage for her and note her shield damage).

Reporting","text":"<p>Reporting is a basic duty of all VOs. Reporting in a timely fashion is critical, especially since all active campaigns are using Achievement Points on the Paizo website, and players may be wanting to use their characters in multiple sessions during the convention. If the HQ staff is willing and can perform this function for your convention, be sure they have the means to do so and have been added as reporters on the event. If your HQ staff will not be performing this function, do your best to get the reporting addressed as quickly as you can so both player, GM, and volunteer Achievement Points are updated. Since OP has indicated the After Action Report should be submitted within a month of the convention completion, good practice would be to also have the reporting done no later than by that same time, at the latest, though having it done within a week of the close of the convention would be preferable. If you need assistance completing the reporting, reach out to other VOs in your chain to enlist their assistance.</p> <p>If your event is for charity and will be awarding Charity Boons, be sure to fill out the Charity Boon Recipient Form after winners are determined.</p> <p>Don\u2019t forget to have your VC or RVC award Achievement Points to your HQ Staff (this function is only available to VCs and RVCs). If your VC is unable to commit to having this done within the same time frame as reporting, reach out to VO. See the Appendix on Awarding Achievement Points as an RVC for this process.</p> <p>Another reporting consideration is the After Action Report. The After Action Report should be filed within one week of the end of the convention, per the most current revision of the Venture-Officer Agreement. Should you need additional time to file the report, it is your responsibility to reach out to the Organized Play Coordinator to explain the circumstances behind the request for additional time. Failure to file the After Action Report (AAR) within 30 days may cause Organized Play to refuse your future support requests. Provided you file your AAR, you are eligible to receive a $50 voucher (given out by OP quarterly) as a way to thank you for your time, effort, and any expenditure of funds for planning the convention. Venture-Lieutenants are eligible to receive one voucher per year. Venture Captains are eligible to receive two vouchers per year. At this time, filing your AAR late does not disqualify you from being voucher eligible, but it may become a disqualifier in the future.</p> <p>It may also be advisable to keep a \u201cKey Learnings\u201d document for yourself of things that occurred or that you learned from the beginning of the planning through the final submission of the After Action Report. This way if you are involved with the convention again in the future, you can refer back to the document as a way to not only give a refresher of what to expect, but as a way to possibly suggest improvements to the convention planners (for instance, if the volunteer sign-up process is too involved, you may be able to suggest changes or at least ask questions about it based on your past experiences).</p> <p>You may also want to send a final email to the volunteer VOs and GMs, thanking them for contributing to the success of the convention, as well as to let them know when reporting has been completed.</p>"},{"location":"organized-play/vo-handbook/#4110-wrapping-up-the-convention","title":"4.1.10.

He was obviously upset and asked to speak with me about an incident that had occurred earlier that evening.</p> <p>Ian told me that during a break in their game, another player (Jim Jameson) cornered him in the hallway. Jim grabbed Ian\u2019s shoulder and asked why \u201che hadn\u2019t healed his [expletive deleted] barbarian,\u201d referring to Ian\u2019s cleric character. When Ian didn\u2019t respond, Jim shook him roughly and said \u201cif he dies, I\u2019m gonna make you pay for the rez,\u201d then left. [See my attached notes for further details of Ian\u2019s report]</p> <p>I thanked Ian for telling me about the issue and asked if he felt safe going home alone. After we returned home, I resolved to make sure they were not seated at the same table in the following weeks, and I reached out to the GM of the game (Kathleen Jones).</p> <p>7/1: Via phone, I spoke with Kathleen Jones about the game the previous evening. She said that she stayed at the table during the break, but that when Ian returned he was very clearly shaken up and didn\u2019t speak much the rest of the evening. She provided me with a list of the players.</p> <p>7/4: I spoke via phone with Robert Smythe, one of the players in the game, privately at another event at The Other Store in Secondtown. Robert said that he saw Ian and Jim in the hall together, but didn\u2019t hear the conversation.</p> <p>7/6: At the following week\u2019s session, I make sure to sit Ian and Jim at separate tables well apart from each other. I checked with Ian to be sure that he was alright and let him know that I was looking into the incident. The two did not have any interactions that night.</p> <p>I also spoke with three of the other players, who confirmed Ian\u2019s change in demeanor after the break. One of the other players had also seen them in the hallway together.</p> <p>Following the game, I asked Jim to stay after and sat down with him and Kathleen to ask for his account of what happened (see attached notes). Jim said that he had talked to Ian during the break, and confirmed that he had asked Ian to heal him more often. When I asked him directly if he had touched Ian, he denied it. I reminded him that bullying and harassment are against the Paizo Organized Play Code of Conduct and asked him again if there had been physical contact, which he denied.</p> <p>Conclusion: Based on my investigation, I have no way to confirm the entirety of Ian\u2019s report. However, regardless of whether or not there was physical contact between the two, I am comfortable saying that there was some level of harassment directed at Ian from Jim. As this is the first offense, I am recommending a two-week suspension from play for Jim at The Cool Fun Store in Anytown beginning on 7/13, and will endeavor to keep the two of them at separate tables for a further two weeks after the suspension is lifted.</p>"},{"location":"organized-play/vo-handbook/#64-incidents-that-do-not-violate-opf-policies","title":"6.4. Incidents that do not Violate OPF Policies","text":"<p>Certain minor-level incidents do not violate the Code of Conduct but warrant attention. A VO doesn't just administer policy, they curate a dynamic community of individuals from a variety of cultures, abilities, worldviews, and personal histories. Some degree of conflict is a natural and expected part of this existence. Conflicts can arise from a variety of sources such as legitimate differences of opinion, uncommunicated agendas, misaligned preferences, personality differences, or miscommunication. For example, sometimes players simply do not get along with one another due to subjective differences in playstyle. At other times, interpersonal issues that do not violate any OPF policies may become a barrier to enjoyment and engagement.</p> <p>In these cases, it is up to the VO to understand the unique context of the situation, serve as a leader, and navigate the situation in a way that is most helpful to their community. As such, this guide cannot instruct VOs on how to handle such conflict (though there is a curated list of further reading at the end of the document). As with Major Incidents, there are some general guidelines.</p> <ul> <li>Respect the privacy of others. If you become aware of a conflict do not discuss it with other players who do not need to know.</li> <li>Uncover the root cause. Often, a conflict may have a deeper root cause that can be discovered through conversation. For example, one player might have misgendered another player several times, leading to outbursts of frustration that seem totally unexpected and unrelated. In this case, a VA seeking the root cause of the problem has uncovered a legitimate infraction and should proceed to resolve it following the appropriate track for OPF policy violations.</li> <li>Focus on behavior and events instead of personalities. A VA should always endeavor to avoid bias and focus on specific incidents instead of their perception of the player(s) in question.</li> <li>Provide feedback where appropriate. A VA may take other approaches, such as providing a GM or player with feedback about their behavior. As always, this kind of effort requires situational leadership and an approach tailored to the context, culture, maturity, and personality of those involved.</li> <li>Help players avoid conflict. In many cases, the optimal situation is to use an avoidance tactic by separating the players before games. This can be achieved by mustering them at different tables. While avoidance is often seen as a poor tactic in the workplace, remember that people attend events for enjoyment. This simple solution can often be leveraged for subjective playstyle differences or personality differences.

Any player can move up the chain from any VO with their concerns at any time, and this is crucial to the integrity of our volunteer corps.

Lessons Learned","text":"<p>This section openly broadcasts what we've learned in the process of working on the guide. We are sharing this section so our audience can better understand the authors' process, and so others have the opportunity to gain from our learning experiences.</p> <ul> <li>International Privacy Compliance:</li> <li>The Taskforce should have an Active, Global Membership to ID and mitigate compliance risks like GDPR.</li> <li>Working with GDPR means using OPF IDs only. We theorize that the OPF can safely use only org play IDs for issues escalated overseas without express player permission, but are awaiting further research from legal.</li> <li>Working with GDPR means performing region-based investigations. To keep the VOs safe from legal issues, we recommend investigations staying in one RVC-owned region.</li> <li>Best Practices for generating docs:</li> <li>Interface with other Taskforces, especially on escalation and privacy issues.</li> <li>Listen to international members and VOs from unique communities; the OPS and VO communities are not monolithic.</li> <li>Get Feedback from the VC/RVC Community before publishing. It helps with buy-in and collective ownership. Encourage curation of further reading lists as the VOs are excited to share their expertise.</li> <li>Documentation and Investigation of Incidents:</li> <li>Document with Tailoring in Mind. We found VCs want to tailor to their region, with a minimum set of standards like an ISO. Write for tailoring best practices from the top-down where possible.</li> <li>Do not Endorse Unofficial Products. Products like RPG Chronicles are oft-used but cost money and are not officially supported.</li> <li>Documentation is required at all incident levels. At the lowest level (minor incidents) docs can be anecdotal but must be captured. VOs wish for a more formalized and rigorous process at moderate + infraction levels.</li> <li>Tracking of bad actors needs to be tailored. VOs should get as much info as possible to ID them in an effective way that works for them.</li> <li>Establish a best practice for RVCs to move an investigation to another part of the chain. Some VOs want this to be required but is not always possible due to region size or language barriers. Thus, a best-practice tailoring approach was chosen over making it required.</li> <li>Document processes for subjective problems that do not break OPF guidelines, but warrant a closer look.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"organized-play/PFS/2e-ap-boons/","title":"2E AP Boons","text":""},{"location":"organized-play/PFS/2e-ap-boons/#blood-lords","title":"Blood Lords","text":""},{"location":"organized-play/PFS/2e-ap-boons/#avid-collector","title":"Avid Collector","text":"<ul> <li>inside ropes</li> <li>horrifying blood loss</li> <li>shadow zombie</li> <li>swallow light</li> <li>teeth to terror or vicious jealousy</li> <li>bralani referendum</li> <li>celestial accord</li> <li>elysian whimsy</li> <li>mantle of Heaven\u2019s slopes</li> <li>movanic glimmer or soulshelter vessel</li> <li>curse of the spirit orchestra or infectious comedy</li> <li>bound in death</li> <li>dirge of rememberance</li> <li>ravenous darkness</li> <li>spiritual torment</li> <li>steal voice</li> <li>suffocate</li> </ul> <p>Cost 20 AcP</p>"},{"location":"organized-play/PFS/2e-ap-boons/#esoteric-spellcaster","title":"Esoteric Spellcaster","text":"<ul> <li>inside ropes</li> <li>horrifying blood loss</li> <li>shadow zombie</li> <li>swallow light</li> <li>teeth to terror or vicious jealousy</li> <li>bralani referendum</li> <li>celestial accord</li> <li>elysian whimsy</li> <li>mantle of Heaven\u2019s slopes</li> <li>movanic glimmer or soulshelter vessel</li> <li>curse of the spirit orchestra or infectious comedy</li> <li>bound in death (book 6, unreleased)</li> <li>dirge of rememberance (book 6, unreleased)</li> <li>ravenous darkness (book 6, unreleased)</li> <li>spiritual torment (book 6, unreleased)</li> <li>steal voice</li> <li>suffocate</li> </ul> <p>Cost 20 AcP</p>"},{"location":"organized-play/PFS/2e-ap-boons/#agents-of-edgewatch","title":"Agents of Edgewatch","text":""},{"location":"organized-play/PFS/2e-ap-boons/#amateur-collector","title":"Amateur Collector","text":"<p>Purchasing this boon grants your character access to all of the following: </p> <ul> <li>Monkey's fist</li> <li>Harrow carrying case</li> <li>Harrow deck</li> <li>Harrow mat</li> </ul> <p>Cost 10 AcP</p>"},{"location":"organized-play/PFS/2e-ap-boons/#avid-collector_1","title":"Avid Collector","text":"<p>Purchasing this boon grants your character access to one of the following items:</p> <ul> <li>recording rod</li> <li>aurifying salts</li> <li>corpseward pendant</li> <li>deafening music box</li> <li>floorbell</li> <li>swarmeater's clasp</li> <li>vaultbreaker's harness</li> <li>daylight vapor</li> <li>death knell powder</li> <li>fearweed</li> <li>liar's demise</li> <li>lifeblight residue</li> <li>repulsion resin</li> <li>sight-theft grit</li> <li>spectral nightshade</li> <li>spell-eating pitch</li> <li>poisoner's staff</li> <li>whisper briolette</li> <li>garotte bolt</li> <li>clockwork cloak</li> </ul> <p>Cost 20 AcP</p>"},{"location":"organized-play/PFS/2e-ap-boons/#esoteric-spellcaster_1","title":"Esoteric Spellcaster","text":"<p>Purchasing this boon grants your character access to the admonishing ray spell as well as one of the following spells: </p> <ul> <li>magical fetters</li> <li>putrefy food and drink</li> <li>imp sting</li> <li>leng sting</li> <li>linnorm sting</li> <li>swarming wasp stings</li> <li>wyvern sting</li> </ul>"},{"location":"organized-play/PFS/2e-ap-boons/#mother-of-nagas","title":"Mother of Nagas","text":"<p>Mother of Nagas (Slotless): You seek to topple the treacherous and restore the Mother of Nagas to her rightful role.

While Painlord's work rather didactic I hope to convey a tone that better fits the sensibilities of the contemporary TTRPG landscape \u2014 one focused on collaboration and teamwork. This is a guide, it is not intended to tell anyone how to play; it's a starting point for thinking about how your PC can be a positive contributor in the Organized Play environment where party compositions are randomized. I am writing it in the first person to position it as my own framework.</p> <p>The baseline question I ask myself is simple: will the party be stronger or weaker with this character in it?</p>  <p>Everyone builds characters differently. I plan out every level, and prefer make choices that are informed at least in part based on the common problems scenarios throw at parties.

If my PC isn't capable of magical or mundane healing, I take a potion from my school items. After the mission briefing my PC takes a moment to mention where it is on their person so allies can feed it to them if they're Dying. I like to do this for two out-of-character reasons: it gives an out-of-character signal that I'm willing to communicate and collaborate, and it demonstrates that I am willing to expend my own resources on keeping my character alive. I have also found this to be tactically efficient: having a potion handy is a habit will that hs saved several of my PCs from death (I've also used my resources to save PCs who don't bring their own).</p> <p>I also try to build new PCs with the essentials: a spare light weapon (often a dagger), a primary weapon, and a ranged weapon (sometimes also dagger). My martial characters purchase a couple of damaging types so they can get through Damage Reduction or capitalize on Weakness easily. </p> <p>If I don\u2019t have darkvision, I try to have a way to create light, even if it\u2019s just a torch or Wayfinder (free at level 2). If I am playing a caster with darkvision, I strongly consider preparing a Light cantrip just to be a good teammate. I liek to cast it on a rock and drop hand it into your human buddy's pocket, or cast it on as word or shield for efficiency and a fun roleplay hook. </p>"},{"location":"organized-play/PFS/pfs-benchmarks/#level-3","title":"Level 3","text":"<p>Here is where most PCs get their first General Feat. If I'm unsure about what to choose, I allow the unpredictable nature of PFS party compositions to guide me. If I am playing lower-con melee type I consider Toughness. A caster might choose Canny Acumen to shore up a weak save and retrain it later, or increase Perception to Expert (perception is used often). Another sleeper hit for PFS is Untrained Improvisation, which helps you make checks the party not always be able to have; at 7th level it becomes a fantastic feat! </p> <p>As a fellow player, I hope everyone at my table now grasps the basics of action economy and will always do something on their turn. I have seen new players get frustrated and say \"I just stand there\" because they're not sure what to do. Since every player at the table increases encounter difficulty; opting out of a turn only makes things more difficult for the whole group; instead of being a net positive, I view players who do not do anything on their turn as net-negatives and feel annoyed with them.</p> <p>What are the basics of the action economy? By now, I hope everyone knows what Stepping, Sustaining, Delaying, and Readying entail. </p> <p>It's also nice to see fellow players utilize their third actions consistenylu. If I'm not sure what to do with a third action I consider the following: raise a shield or cast shield, stride into a safer position or a flank, set up an Aid, or Recall Knowledge. In most cases, trying something is better than doing nothing. </p> <p>Every +1 counts. My Martial characters have a magic weapon the moment they hit level 3. if proficient, hey have a few bombs to deal with swarms and Damage Reduction or Regeneration. I liek to buy Holy Waters on every PC as well \u2014 it's super effective against creatures weak to good damage (Society games pit us agianst many evil creatures, so it's a good bet you will encounter enemies vilnerable to Good damage).</p> <p>When I am on the other side of the screen as a GM, I also hope players can now start speaking Pathfinder in ways that keep the game flowing smoothly. For example, players can include DCs when you cast spells:</p>  <p>I cast Fear; DC 21 Basic Will Save for the dire Corgi.</p>  <p>Many players are still be learning the finer points of the system or their PC's mechanics, but having a foundation to build on is important. </p>"},{"location":"organized-play/PFS/pfs-benchmarks/#level-5","title":"Level 5","text":"<p>This is a point at which the game becomes a lot more exciting (and challenging). For the ability boost, I always consider increasing Constitution. With four boosts it's difficult for me to find a reason to skip this on any build. My thinking on this is that PFS isn\u2019t a home game where you might always have a healer to pick you up, or the sheltering wing of a Champion to let you go all-out on offense. Staying alive one more round or or taking one more hit you can help your whole team operate smoothly. </p> <p>At this point, my martials have more than one weapon with which to solve problems, or they're prepared to just do big enough damage to fight through higher damage resistance/hardness (e.g. Power Attack or Rage).</p> <p>unless I hvae access to MAge Armor, my first purchase at level 5 is always an Armor Potency rune\u2026 even on my casters. A +1 AC can make a world of difference, between a crit that knocks oyu down and a hit. </p> <p>My casters also start investing in scrolls for utility \u2014 options include resist energy (great against persistent damage), glitterdust/faerie fire, spider climb (deal with terrain), Heal/Soothe, Restoration, Water Walk, and similar utility scrolls. This is a collection that will someday become a library of party-saving magic. I will often have a wand or two as well (for example, level 2 Longstrider and False Life provide all-day utility).</p> <p>My Martials also strive for party-enhancing utility, whether that is debuffs (intimidation provides one of the best debuffs in the game), face skills, crafting, etc. They can also purchase items to contribute in a variety of situations, such as by buying silvertongue mutagens to contribute in a social endeavor or emerald grasshoppers to solve terrain.</p> <p>Speaking of, scenarios now start throwing challenging terrain at you with high frequency. It's often baked into the encounter as part of the challenge rating.

To mitigate this a potion of Darkvision can help a lot, as can Faerie Fire or Glitterdust.</p> <p>Spike damage can be a factor as well; I try to  have a way to heal myself for a non-trivial amount (healer's gloves, potions purchased with my own gold that are near my level). I also carry around \"break in case of emergency\" tools such as potions of invisibility (uncommon, but available through school training), stronger elemental bombs, etc. These are important \"break in case of emergency\" items that even casters can buy. </p> <p>Casters now have the opportunity to work on an improved utility library: Remove Curse, Remove Disease, Air Walk, See Invisibility, Earthbind, and Neutralize Poison have all made me the hero of the day.

Edicts are behaviors your personal philosophy or code encourages. Anathema are the opposite: actions contrary to your point of view and violations of your personal code. For example, you might declare that you follow an edict to keep detailed records of any dungeon you explore, or you might consider it anathema to refuse to help a friend in need.</p> <p>For most characters, these are entirely optional, though it\u2019s best to consider taking on some as you create your character to home in on how they think.

You\u2019ll note chaos, law, and neutrality don\u2019t have equivalents as their scope was far more limited and they matter much less in the game world. Some characters, notably clerics in Player Core, can choose to become sanctified. We may issue errata for other major character options that relied on alignment, but it\u2019s unlikely that every single base will be covered. The rules text for sanctification and the related traits is as follows.</p> <p>Sanctification: Some deities sanctify their clerics and similarly devoted followers. This gives the follower the holy or unholy trait. The holy trait indicates a powerful devotion to altruism, helping others, and battling against unholy forces like fiends and undead. The unholy trait, in turn, shows devotion to victimizing others, inflicting harm, and battling celestial powers. Deities that list \u201cmust choose\u201d require gaining the trait, and those that list \u201ccan choose\u201d give the devotee the option to choose the trait or not. You can have the holy trait, unholy trait, or neither, but can never have both the holy and unholy traits.</p> <p>Spells and other effects can also have these traits, making them more powerful against creatures with the opposite trait. Some spells and abilities have the sanctified trait. This means that when you use the ability you add the holy trait or unholy trait to the ability if you have that trait.</p> <p>Holy (Trait): Effects with the holy trait are tied to powerful magical forces of benevolence and virtue. They often have stronger effects on unholy creatures. Creatures with this trait are strongly devoted to holy causes and often have weakness to unholy. If a creature with weakness to holy uses a holy item or effect, it takes damage from its weakness.</p> <p>Unholy (Trait): Effects with the unholy trait are tied to powerful magical forces of cruelty and sin. They often have stronger effects on holy creatures. Creatures with this trait are strongly devoted to unholy causes and often have weakness to holy. If a creature with weakness to unholy uses an unholy item or effect, it takes damage from its weakness.</p> <p>Sanctified: If you are holy or unholy, your sanctified actions and spells gain the same trait.</p>"},{"location":"second-edition/core-preview/#spirit-damage","title":"Spirit Damage","text":"<p>Though this damage type isn\u2019t used in Rage of Elements, the Remaster rules introduce spirit damage. This will replace alignment damage (chaotic damage, good damage, evil damage, and lawful damage) in many situations. But beyond that, it also covers many situations where there wasn\u2019t truly a suitable damage type.</p> <p>Spirit Damage: Directly affecting the spiritual essence of a creature, spirit damage can damage a target projecting its consciousness or possessing another creature even if the target\u2019s body is elsewhere. The possessed creature isn\u2019t harmed by the blast. Spirit damage doesn\u2019t harm creatures that have no spirit, such as constructs. Many effects that deal spirit damage also have the sanctified, holy, or unholy trait.</p>"},{"location":"second-edition/core-preview/#fast-changes","title":"Fast Changes","text":"<p>Alignment changes are the most extensive in the Remaster. If you want to use them in your game immediately, in most cases you can make pretty quick adjustments on the fly to adapt. Take care to make sure you don\u2019t miss something, and be ready to alter your plan if the change doesn\u2019t seem to be working as you intended.</p> <p>Creature Stat Blocks: Remove the alignment entry from all creatures. If a creature\u2019s nature is strongly suffused with the magic of good or evil, the creature has the holy or unholy trait, and often its Strikes and other actions do too. Celestials have the holy trait. Fiends and undead have the unholy trait. (As with most things, there are occasional exceptions.) A cleric, champion, herald, or similar follower of a deity might be sanctified as well, gaining the appropriate holy or unholy trait.</p> <p>Aligned Damage: Change chaotic damage, evil damage, good damage, and lawful damage to spirit damage. If you have a bit more time, you can instead incorporate that damage into the other damage of the attack if it makes sense, increasing the physical damage instead, for example. Consider adding the holy trait or unholy trait to an action, spell, or item if it\u2019s often strongly themed to a deity or the metaphysical fight of good versus evil.</p> <p>Deity Sanctification: There\u2019s no quick change for sanctification. If a player wants their character to be sanctified, you can follow what the story suggests should be true for the character and their deity. For instance, it makes perfect sense for a devout cleric of Sarenrae who has been dedicated to battling fiends and undead to be sanctified to holy. However, a cleric of Cayden Cailean who hasn\u2019t shown any strong drive to fight for a cause might not be sanctified.
