This guide is meant to serve as a very brief overview to help players acclimate the the basics. System Requirements \u2691 Foundry is a modern application that runs in a browser window; as such, you should make sure that your machine can run it. Relatively modern computer running Windows 10, MacOS, or Linux operating systems with support for 64-bit architecture. An integrated GPU to enable hardware acceleration. 8GB of RAM A monitor no smaller than 1366x768. At this minimum resolution many aspects of the UI will feel cramped. A modern web browser like Chrome, Firefox, Opera, or Edge with hardware acceleration enabled. (Safari is not a supported browser at this time). \u2014 Source: Foundry Docs Logging In \u2691 Foundry can be run in a variety of configurations. Mine is on a self-hosted server that is almost always on. To join a game, navigate to the URL in your browser and select the user name the GM assigned to you. You probably do not need an access key (password). If you were assigned one, the GM should have told you and you would enter it here. Play Area Overview \u2691 Foundry operates within a canvas, or play area. There are three main areas you need to be concerned about as a player: the Canvas Layer Tools, the Sidebar and its Tabs, and the Macro and players area. The Foundry Canvas (Source: foundryvtt.com) Canvas Layer Tools \u2691 The toolbar on the left has two columns: the leftmost column is the tool, and the rightmost column are options within that tool. The top icon, the Token icon, is where you can select your token and move it, use Targeting, or to Measure Distance . The middle icon is the Spell Templates function. The Pencil icon is the Draw Shape function. Sidebar and tabs \u2691 The sidebar has several tabs. You can collapse the sidebar, then drag any table out into its own window. This is especially useful for combat. Bubble: The chat tab, where the dice rolling will happen. Fist: The combat tracker. Group of People: The Actors you can see in the game; your own PC and any minions are here, and can be edited when you click on them. The Briefcase: The game's items. The GM may put special items here and you can reference them. Open Book: Journal entries for the scene. You can even create your own. Tables: Randomized tables. You probably don't need to worry about this. Music: Music settings. I don't use music. Book: Compendiums. These are groups of items or actors that have been shared with you. They include spells, feats, actors, items, and macros. This is a great area to look up spells, conditions, etc. Gears: Player settings. You can change the UI skin, help solve frame rate issues, and other basic options. Arrow : Collapses Menu Interacting with the Canvas \u2691 Movement \u2691 You can drag your token anywhere you like. If you command-click on the token (control-click on windows), you can measure distance. If you click multiple times you can set waypoints. Press the space bar when you are ready to move, or right-click to reset. Highlight a Target \u2691 Click on the Target icon on the left. Click on the token you want to target. This will highlight it on the map for you. Alternatively, you can hover over the token you want to target and press \"T\" on your keyboard. Measure Distance \u2691 Click on the Ruler icon and drag out the distance. As with movement, you can command/control click to set up waypoints. Spell Templates \u2691 Select the right-angle ruler in the toolbar on the left, then select the type of spell. There is a circle for bursts, an angle for cones, a square for concurrent surface area, and an arrow for lines. Once you have the template dragged out, you can move it around. You can select the template to delete it when you're finished. Don't forget to delete the template when you're done, and that unless you select another tool Foundry will assume you want to add more templates. Journal Notes \u2691 If your GM has entered any journal notes for the area, you can click on this icon to highlight them. Double click on the journal icon to open it up. Creating A PC \u2691 This section covers how to create your token and character sheet. Actors \u2691 One of the fundamental objects within the Foundry Virtual Tabletop is the Actor . Actors are the protagonists, allies, monsters, antagonists, and persons within the World that you create. The game System being used has control to define the exact types of actors which are relevant for it\u2019s gameplay, but for most tabletop roleplaying systems these actors will represent the characters which the player Users impersonate and the foes they encounter. You have permission to create your own PC \u2014 an actor! Here's how to do that: Clicking on the icon in the sidebar that that looks like a group of people. At the bottom click Create Actor Name your PC Leave Character selected as its type Click Create Actor Creating your Token \u2691 After you create the Actor, you can double-click on it in the Actors sidebar to edit it and create a token. A Token represents the piece on the Game Board, and has several important settings. (If you just created a new actor, you will immediately be taken to the Character Sheet screen). To create a token for your PC, use the following steps: Click on Prototype Token in the character sheet (A \"prototype token\" is one that has not been placed on the board yet) Name the token however you want (this should already be correct) Select Hover on Display Name so others can see your token's name. Click on Image Select the image (follow steps outlined in Choosing an Existing Avatar Image using the file browser, or the steps in Uploading a new Avatar Image) Click on Vision If you have Darkvision enter its feet under Dim Vision If you normal have a light source in dark areas, enter its radius in the dim and bright fields under Emit Dim and Emit Bright . Both sources come from your token, so a Light spell that emits 20 feet of bright light and 20 feet of dim light should be set to 40 feet of dim and 20 feet of bright (which overlaps the dim). Click Update Token. Player Tokens Should Always be Round! Many GMs prefer to designate PCs and NPC tokens via shapes. This allows the user to quickly identify a fellow PC's token on the board, and an NPC's. In my games, NPCs should always be square, and PCs should always be round. Avatars \u2691 After logging in, you will be directed to choose your player avatar. The default is a mysterious, hooded person. I tend to make players trusted, so you can upload your own character avatar. Not all GMs will do this, and you may have to talk to them about getting your avatar set up. The default Avatar, a mysterious figure indeed! Uploading a new Avatar Image \u2691 To upload a new avatar, do the following: Click on the avatar image Click on \"User Data\" at the top of the image browser (this should be the default) Click on \"dragupload\" Click \"Choose File\" Click \"Select File\" Choosing an Existing Avatar Image \u2691 I have a library of images from previous games, and they are ready to share with you! If you played with me before, it's likely I moved your uploaded tokens to the correct folder as well. Click on the avatar image Click on the Up arrow until you see Assets Click on Assets Click on PC Art (or whatver directory your gm has the artwork in) Select your token (note that there are a variety of view options next to Display Mode so you can see previews of the image) Click Select File Changing your Actor's Avatar \u2691 Your character can have different art from its token. This art will also show up in the \"Actors\" pane and on the sheet. This is true for any Actor, in fact. To add or change an actor's avatar, use the following steps: Open the character sheet Click on the big avatar image Select the image or upload an image (follow steps outlined in Choosing an Existing Avatar Image using the file browser, or the steps in Uploading a new Avatar Image ) Adding your Character Token to the Map \u2691 You can now drag your token onto the map, and it will have the correct settings. If the GM has the map set with darkness (such as nighttime or in a cavern) you will only see a black screen and a warning. Just drag your token onto the map if the GM hasn't done so for you. If you want to change these settings on the token for just one map, double-click on the token and adjust the vision under the \"token\" window. If you want to update the token's settings so you can use it again later, update the prototype token under the Actors pane so it's always set correctly. The examples here are for Pathfinder 2e, but 1e will have a similar process. Editing Your Character Sheet \u2691 You can edit your character. This can be exported later on to port between Foundry games. However, for my games I do not require a complete character sheet \u2014 we use the honor system here. However, there are some useful things you can add. Hit Points \u2691 You can edit hit points to track them in combat. To do so: Open character sheet Add your Level Add your Constitution Add your Ancestry HP Add your Class HP Add your bonus HP and Bonus HP/level (Toughness, etc) Add your Current HP (match the Total HP) You should see a full health bar under your token Adjusting Hit Points \u2691 You can adjust the hit points in a variety of ways. Right click on the token Enter the damage or a negative integer under the health bar to take damage. Add a \"+\" sign to get healed Hit enter The health bar will be updated. This can give players a visual clue about your health without metagaming too much Initiative Modifier \u2691 I like to roll initiatives with a macro that rolls for everyone and sots it \u2014 this means it's helpful to add your initiative mod to your sheet. Select the ability used under Initiative Fill out that part of the sheet Select Proficiency if Perception (left click to increase, right to decrease) Add any bonuses from feats, etc (for example, Battlefield Surveyor for fighter) Close Sheet Perception for Initiative Other Skill for Initiative Rolling Dice \u2691 To roll dice go to the chat log. It's the bubble on the rightmost side. Then, type your command prefixed by \"/roll\": / roll 1 d20 + 14 + 2 You can do very simple macros that combine attack and damage. Here is an example of a character with a striking flail with crit specialization, and sneak attack: I attack with my flail to hit AC [[ 1 d20 + 14 ]] for [[ 2 d8 + 4 ]] slashing damage and [[ 2 d6 ]] sneak if flat - footed and prone if crit You could integrate deadly, fatal, and anything else you like here. Macros \u2691 Macros are useful tools. The above attack and damage example is an example of a macro. You can edit your own macros on the hotbar. You can also add them from compendiums that you have access to (note that some compendium macros may require you to have your character sheet fully set up). The main goal here is to get you started with fast, simple macros and not to do anything overly complex. Macros are very powerful, and get complex fast! Building a Macro \u2691 Click on the hotbar . If there's already a macro there, right-click to edit or remove. Name the Macro Enter the macro type ( chat is the default and works fins for simple macros; script is a javascript macro) Select the macro image (there are images available in the default library) Enter the Macro Text Click Execute Macro to test Click Save Macro if it works You can use the macro by tapping the number on your keypad or clicking it Using a Compendium Macro \u2691 Click on the Compendium area on the right sidebar Scroll down the the Macros section Click on the category. A new window will open. Click on the macro you want to use in order to preview it Drag the macro you want to your hotbar Right-click and edit the macro to your liking, or click on it to execute it The GM may make a variety of compendiums available. I have a default set of simple attack/damage with multiple attack penalties, saves, and perception.","title":"Basics"},{"location":"foundry/foundry-basics/#foundry-basics","text":"It is worth noting that Foundry has deep documentation, built by their community, on their website .

When making these alchemical elixirs, you can substitute alchemical reagents for an equal value of magical components, and you can use alchemist\u2019s tools (for Quick Alchemy) or an alchemist\u2019s lab (for the Craft activity) instead of any other required tool kits.\u201d Page 85: \u2691 In the barbarian's greater juggernaut class feature, change the last sentence to read \u201cWhen you roll a failure on a Fortitude save against an effect that deals damage, you halve the damage you take.\u201d This removes confusion about how to handle critical failures on saves against damaging effects. Page 86: \u2691 In Table 3\u20133: Animal Instincts, change the deer\u2019s Damage entry to 1d10 P and replace the \u201ccharge\u201d trait with the \u201cgrapple\u201d trait. Page 87: \u2691 In the barbarian's Titan Mauler (Instinct Ability), change \u201cYou gain access to a weapon one size larger than you\u201d to \u201cYou gain access to this larger weapon\u201d This accounts for Small creatures using a weapon built for a Large creature, as stated in the previous sentence. Page 90: \u2691 In the barbarian's Wounded Rage class feat, remove the Rage trait. Page 91: \u2691 In the barbarian's Terrifying Howl class feat, change \u201ceach creature\u201d to \u201ceach enemy.\u201d Page 93: \u2691 The barbarian's Dragon Transformation class feat uses your class DC for the breath weapon at 16th and at 18th levels, rather than the DC listed for 18th level. Page 93: \u2691 In the barbarian's Brutal Critical class feat, change the second sentence to read \u201cOn a critical hit with a melee Strike, add one extra damage die.\u201d Pages 101\u2013102: \u2691 In the bard's Eclectic Skill class feat, change the second sentence to \u201cYour proficiency bonus to untrained skill checks is equal to your level.\u201d This matches the language of the Untrained Improvisation general feat and removes any ambiguity as to whether they combine. Page 103: \u2691 Remove the Requirement in the bard's Effortless Concentration to match all the other Effortless Concentration feats. Page 108: \u2691 In the champion's Deific Weapon class feature, change the second sentence to read \u201cIf it\u2019s an unarmed attack with a d4 damage die or a simple weapon, increase the damage die by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12). Page 108: \u2691 In the champion's Divine Ally feat, change the first three sentences to read \u201cA spirit of battle dwells within your armaments. Select one weapon or handwraps of mighty blows when you make your daily preparations. In your hands, the item gains the effect of a property rune.\u201d This supports champions with a deity that has an unarmed attack as a favored weapon. Page 112: \u2691 Add tenets of good to the Prerequisites of Smite Evil. We accidentally omitted it. Page 113: \u2691 Blade of Justice should not be limited to paladins only. Remove the paladin prerequisite from Blade of Justice, and the last sentence becomes \"Whether or not the target is evil, you can convert all the physical damage from the attack into good damage, and if you are a paladin, the Strike applies all effects that normally apply on a Retributive Strike (such as divine smite).\" Page 121: \u2691 Deadly Simplicity had a benefit for unarmed attack favored weapons, but such clerics did not actually qualify. Change the prerequisites to add unarmed attacks. Several classes were accidentally missing an important limitation for 10th level spells. In the following class features, add \u201cYou can\u2019t use this spell slot for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or that give you more spell slots.\u201d Page 121: Miraculous Spell Page 133: Primal Hierophant Page 207: Archwizard's Spellcraft Page 125: \u2691 Emblazon Antimagic has the wrong counteract level. Change it to \"your counteract level is equal to half your level, rounded up\" Page 129: \u2691 Druid mistakenly was trained in a class DC, when it shouldn't have a class DC. Remove it. Page 132: \u2691 In Table 3\u201311: Druid Spells per Day, change the Cantrips entry at each level from 4 to 5, just like other spellcasters. Page 135: \u2691 Remove the \u201cone-action\u201d glyph from the druid's Poison Resistance class feat. This benefit is perpetual. Page 138: \u2691 In Plant Shape, the level of the plant form spell if you don't have Wild Shape wasn't clear. It should say it's \" heightened to the same level as your highest druid spell slot\" Page 139: \u2691 Hierophant's Power wasn't supposed to have the prerequisite of legendary in Nature; it's a holdover from the playtest. Remove the prerequisite. Page 145: \u2691 The adjustment to the Aid reaction after the playtest caused Assisting Shot not to do anything. Replace it with this version. Assisting Shot [one-action] Feat 2 Fighter, Press Requirements You are wielding a ranged weapon. With a quick shot, you interfere with a foe in combat. Make a Strike with a ranged weapon. If the strike hits, the next creature other than you to attack the same target before the start of your next turn gains a +1 circumstance bonus on their roll, or a +2 circumstance bonus if your Strike was a critical hit. Page 151: \u2691 In the fighter's Incredible Ricochet class feat, the narrative of the feat involves using the first shot to help target the next shot. Change the second sentence to \u201cMake a ranged weapon Strike against a creature you previously attacked this turn.\u201d Page 152: \u2691 Determination has the wrong counteract level. Change it to \"your counteract level is equal to half your level, rounded up\" Page 156: \u2691 In the monk's Powerful Fist class feature, in the second sentence replace \u201cchanges\u201d with \u201cincreases\u201d to make it clear the normal rules on increases to die sizes apply. Page 157: \u2691 In the monk's Key Terms sidebar, under the Ki Spells entry, add \u201cand your key spellcasting ability is Wisdom\u201d to the end of the second paragraph. Pages 159 and 163: \u2691 In the monk's Mountain Stance and Tangled Forest Stance class feats, change the \u201cTrigger\u201d heading to \u201cRequirements.\u201d The content of each entry remains the same. Page 163: \u2691 Sleeper Hold shouldn't have the attack trait, meaning it doesn't apply or increase your multiple attack penalty. Page 164: \u2691 Change the action glyph for the monk's Stance Savant class feat to [free-action] instead of [reaction]. Page 165: \u2691 Master of Many Styles lists \"Your turn begins\" as a requirement, but it should be a trigger. Change it to a trigger. Page 169: \u2691 In the ranger's nature\u2019s edge class feature, remove \u201con natural uneven ground\u201d as it's redundant. Page 172: \u2691 Change the action glyph for the ranger's Disrupt Prey class feat to [reaction] instead of [free-action]. Page 174: \u2691 In the ranger's Terrain Master class feat, remove \u201cwild stride\u201d from the Prerequisites entry. Page 175: \u2691 In the ranger's Lightning Snares class feat, add \u201cQuick Snares\u201d to the Prerequisites entry. Page 176: \u2691 In the ranger's Stealthy Companion class feat, add \u201cAnimal Companion\u201d to the Prerequisites entry. Page 177: \u2691 In order to make it completely clear how the Manifold Edge feat works, change the second sentence to read \"When you use Hunt Prey, you can gain a hunter\u2019s edge benefit other than the one you selected at 1st level.\" With the previous wording, a few people thought you gained both benefits, rather than a substitution. Page 184: \u2691 In the rogue's Minor Magic class feat, add the following sentence. \u201cYour key spellcasting ability is Charisma, and you\u2019re trained in spell attack rolls and DCs for the tradition of your chosen cantrips.\u201d Page 185: \u2691 In the rogue's Poison Weapon class feat, if you're already holding the poison, you shouldn't need a free hand. Remove \u201cand have a free hand\u201d from the Requirements and remove \u201cand have a free hand\u201d from the Requirements entry and change the first sentence to read \u201cYou apply a poison to the required weapon; if you\u2019re not holding a poison and have a free hand, you can Interact to draw a poison as part of this action.\u201d Page 188: \u2691 Blank Slate, like a few other entries, was still erroneously running on a level 1 to 20 scale for counteract levels. Replace \"counteract level of 20\" with \"counteract level of 10.\" Page 189: \u2691 Dispelling Slice should use the default counteract level of \"half your level (rounded up)\", in the final sentence. Page 194: \u2691 Add the following sorcerer class feature at 17th level: Resolve You\u2019ve steeled you mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increase to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead. Page 197: \u2691 In the sorcerer's Elemental Type section of the elemental bloodline, change the last sentence to read \u201cReplace any existing elemental traits with the trait of the element you chose.\u201d Page 199: \u2691 In the Sorcerer Feats sidebar, change the level of \u201cBespell Weapon\u201d from 6 to 4 to match the feat itself. Page 201: \u2691 Remove the arcane trait from Greater Mental Evolution and the divine trait from Greater Vital Evolution, both sorcerer class feats. Pages 204 and 206: \u2691 Wizards gain their first class feat at 2nd level, like other spellcasters. On page 204, in Table 3-18: Wizard Advancement, remove \u201cwizard feat\u201d from the 1st-level entry. On page 206, in the Wizard Feats section, change the first sentence to \u201cAt 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a wizard class feat.\u201d Page 205: \u2691 In Drain Bonded Item, remove the unnecessary Requirement of \"Your turn begins.\" Page 214: \u2691 In the first paragraph, replace the first two sentences with the following to clarify the specific action required to command your animal companion, and that it doesn\u2019t require a check. Replace with: An animal companion is a loyal comrade who follows your orders. Your animal companion has the minion trait, and it gains 2 actions during your turn if you use the Command an Animal action to command it; this is in place of the usual effects of Command an Animal, and you don\u2019t need to attempt a Nature check.\" Page 214: \u2691 Under Young Animal Companions, add the sentence \u201cAn animal companion has the same level you do.\u201d In the same paragraph, change the maximum item bonus to AC an animal companion can gain from +2 to +3. Page 217: \u2691 In the ambusher section, remove \u201cIt gains a +2 circumstance bonus to initiative rolls using Stealth\u201d since a companion acts on your initiative and therefore this clause provides no benefit. Page 217: \u2691 Familiars' level wasn't explicit. Add \"A familiar has the same level you do.\" The description of familiars didn't define any Strikes but also wasn't explicit that they couldn't make them. Add \"It can't make Strikes\" to the beginning of the third sentence. Page 219: \u2691 Under Spellcasting Archetypes, in the Basic Spellcasting Feat, change the second sentence to \u201cAt 6th level, they grant you a 2nd\u2011level spell slot, and if you have a spell repertoire, you can select one spell from your repertoire as a signature spell.\u201d In the Expert Spellcasting Feat, after the first sentence, add \u201cIf you have a spell repertoire, you can select a second spell from your repertoire as a signature spell.\u201d In the Master Spellcasting Feat, after the first sentence, add \u201cIf you have a spell repertoire, you can select a third spell from your repertoire as a signature spell.\u201d Spellcasting Dedication Feats (pages 222, 224, 225, and 230) \u2691 In the spellcasting dedication feats, you can prepare or add to your repertoire common cantrips of your spellcasting tradition, whether from this book or other cantrips of that tradition you learn or discover. Page 230: \u2691 In the Sorcerer Dedication feat, replace the second sentence of the second paragraph with \u201cYou gain a spell repertoire with two common cantrips from the spell list associated with your bloodline, from the spells granted by your bloodline, or any other cantrips of that tradition you learn or discover.\u201d This grants access to the bloodline-granted cantrips as well as those on the associated spell list. Page 233: \u2691 Clarifying the general rule on repeated skill training that gives you a replacement skill, add at the end of the second paragraph \"though if the skill is a Lore skill, the new skill must also be a Lore skill\" Page 242: \u2691 In Grapple, the restrained condition doesn't technically also make a creature grabbed, so to make it clear, in the requirements of the action and at the end of the first paragraph about not needing a hand if you're already grabbing someone, change \"grabbed\" to \"grabbed or restrained\" Page 244: \u2691 The Craft downtime activity requires an alchemist\u2019s lab, not just alchemist\u2019s tools. See the errata for page 287. Page 248: \u2691 To reflect the clarification on healer's tools allowing you to draw them as part of the action if you're wearing them, change the Requirements to \"You are holding healer's tools, or you are wearing them and have a hand free\" Page 249: \u2691 Add \"Drop Prone\" to the list of basic commands you can tell your animal friend to lie down. Page 255: \u2691 In Table 5\u20132: General Skill Feats, change the description of Automatic Knowledge from \u201conce per day\u201d to \u201conce per round.\u201d It was correct in the text but not the table. Page 258: \u2691 In Battle Medicine, change the Requirements entry to \u201cYou are holding or wearing healer's tools.\u201d Change the second sentence of the effect to \u201cAttempt a Medicine check with the same DC as for Treat Wounds, and restore a corresponding amount of Hit Points; this does not remove the wounded condition.\u201d This means you need to use your healer's tools for Battle Medicine, but you can draw and replace worn tools as part of the action due to the errata on wearing tools on page 287. Update: We will be updating the tools revamp to indicate that worn healer's tools (along with other tool kits) take only one hand to use, as you don't have to hold the whole kit in your other hand, just pull out the things you need. What this means for Battle Medicine is that you only need one free hand to perform it with worn healer's tools, you don't need both hands. Page 259: \u2691 Bonded Animal didn't explain the logistics of bonding the animal directly, leading a small number of people to be unsure that it was necessary to locate and interact with the animal to bond with it. To make it explicit, change the second sentence to \"You can spend 7 days of downtime regularly interacting with a normal animal (\u2026) that is friendly or helpful to you.\" Page 260: \u2691 The Cloud Jump feat referred to exceeding a \"limit\" without spelling out exactly which limit. It's supposed to be the limit of not being able to Leap farther than your Speed. To make it clear, change the second paragraph to read \"You can jump a distance greater than your Speed by spending additional actions when you Long Jump or High Jump. For each additional action spent, add your Speed to the limit on how far you can Leap.\" As an example, supposing you had a Speed of 40 feet and 25 on your Athletics check, Cloud Jump triples the 25 feet to 75 feet, but the limit of 40 feet still applies so you would jump 40 feet. If you spent another action, the limit based on your Speed would raise from 40 feet to 80 feet, so you would jump 75 feet. Page 260: \u2691 The Connections feat requires a great deal of improvisation and adjudication on the part of a GM, more in line with an option that has uncommon rarity due to the narrative load. Because of this, change the feat's rarity to uncommon. Page 260 \u2691 Dubious Knowledge's effect should only happen on a failure, not a critical failure. Change the effect to explicitly state it doesn't occur on a critical failure. Page 268: \u2691 Because the word \"action\" could have broad or narrow scopes, it wasn't clear exactly when you could use the Unified Theory feat to substitute Arcana for the other magical skills. Change the beginning of the second sentence to \"Whenever you use a skill action or a skill feat\" to make it clear you can use it with skill actions (such as the ones in Chapter 4) and skill feat, but not for other actions, such as when casting spells or rituals. Page 268: \u2691 In Toughness, change the last sentence to read \u201cThe DC of recovery checks is equal to 9 + your dying condition value (page 459).\u201d Held, Worn, and Stowed Items \u2691 Page 271: \u2691 We've simplified the way we're handling characters carrying their gear so that you can define all your carried items in one of three categories. Replace the carrying and using items section with this text: \"A character carries items in three ways: held, worn, and stowed. Held items are in your hands; a character typically has two hands, allowing them to hold an item in each hand or a single two-handed item using both hands. Worn items are tucked into pockets, belt pouches, bandoliers, weapon sheaths, and so forth, and they can be retrieved and returned relatively quickly. Stowed items are in a backpack or a similar container, and they are more difficult to access. Drawing a worn item or changing how you\u2019re carrying an item usually requires you to use an Interact action (though to drop an item, you use the Release action instead). Table 6\u20132: Changing Equipment on page 273 lists some ways that you might change the items you\u2019re holding or carrying, and the number of hands you need to do so. Many ways of using items require you to spend multiple actions. For example, drinking a potion worn at your belt requires using an Interact action to draw it and then using a second action to drink it as described in its Activate entry (page 532).\" This change also removes several sorts of \"container\" items from the tables on 286-292, as they are no longer tracked separately from the items they store. These are: bandolier belt pouch satchel scroll case sheath vial Page 287 adds a paragraph on Wearing Tools \u2691 You can make a set of tools (such as alchemist\u2019s tools or healer\u2019s tools) easier to use by wearing it. This allows you to draw and replace the tools as part of the action that uses them. You can wear up to 2 Bulk of tools in this manner; tools beyond this limit must be stowed or drawn with an Interact action to use.\" Fine clothing reduces that limit to light Bulk worth of tools. Update: Worn tools should only take 1 hand to use, as you only draw the things you need from the kit and not the entire kit. This has been marked for future errata. Page 275: \u2691 Under the Armor Traits heading, change the entry for Noisy to \u201cNoisy: This armor is loud and likely to alert others to your presence. The armor\u2019s check penalty applies to Stealth checks even if you meet the required Strength score.\u201d Page 278: \u2691 Under Improvised Weapons, add the sentence \u201cImprovised weapons are simple weapons.\u201d This dictates the proficiency modifier you use. Page 278: \u2691 In critical hits, \"When you make an attack and roll a natural 20...or if the result of your attack exceeds the target's AC by 10\" was too broad a brush and thus slightly inaccurate for how to determine a critical hit, in an attempt to state the conditions succinctly. Replace the first section with \"When you make an attack and succeed with a natural 20\" so that's it's clear the natural 20 must succeed based on the total result in order to get a critical success. Page 280: \u2691 Under the Ammunition heading, add the sentence \u201cUsing ammunition destroys it.\u201d Page 283: \u2691 Weapon traits. In the definition of the Parry weapon trait, change \"spend an Interact action\" to \"spend a single action\" to make it so setting up a parry doesn't trigger Attacks of Opportunity or similar reactions. In the definition for the thrown weapon trait, change the first sentence to \u201cYou can throw this weapon as a ranged attack, and it is a ranged weapon when thrown.\u201d In the definition for the unarmed weapon trait, the sentence \"a fist or other grasping appendage follows the same rules as a free-hand weapon\" was worded in such a way it confused a few people, who thought that meant those unarmed attacks were weapons, despite statements to the contrary on page 278. To make it clear, change that section to read \"a fist or other grasping appendage generally works like a free-hand weapon\" Page 283: \u2691 In Critical Specialization Effects, it uses the generic term attack but should specifically refer to Strikes. In the first sentence, change \"when you make an attack with certain weapons\" to \"when you make a Strike with certain weapons\" Page 288: \u2691 Change the price of the the adventurer's pack to 15 sp and the bedroll to 2 cp. Page 289: \u2691 Due to other changes (particularly the adventurer's pack, which was in all of the kits), the Bulk and cost of all of the class kits have changed. All kits are included in full in this entry so you don't have to cross-reference two places to use them.

Page 293: \u2691 In Table 6\u201312: Magical Gear, change the Price of the minor healing potion from 3 gp to 4 gp. It was correct in the main entry on page 563. Page 293: \u2691 Under Consumable Magic Items, change holy water to deal \u201c1d6 good damage and 1 good splash damage.\u201d Change unholy water to deal \u201c1d6 evil damage and 1 evil splash damage\u201d instead of \u201c1d6 good damage.\u201d Changes to Make Bulk Less Restrictive \u2691 The following changes make Bulk limits less restrictive for your character. Page 287: \u2691 Add the following entry for an alchemist\u2019s lab: Alchemist\u2019s Lab: You need an alchemist\u2019s lab to Craft alchemical items during downtime. An expanded alchemist\u2019s lab gives a +1 item bonus to Crafting checks to create alchemical items. Page 287: \u2691 Amend the Alchemist\u2019s Tools entry to the following: Alchemist\u2019s Tools: This mobile collection of vials and chemicals can be used for simple alchemical tasks. Page 287: \u2691 In the Backpack description, add this sentence: \u201cThe first 2 Bulk of items in your backpack don\u2019t count against your Bulk limits.\u201d Similarly \"The first 1 Bulk of items in each saddlebag doesn't count against your mount's Bulk limits.\" Page 288: \u2691 Make the following changes on Table 6\u20139: Adventuring Gear. Change the Bulk of the adventurer\u2019s pack from 2 to 1. Change the Bulk of formula book (blank) and spellbook (blank) from 1 to L Add \u201cAlchemist\u2019s Lab\u201d (Price 5 gp, Bulk 6, Hands 2) Change \u201cExpanded Alchemist\u2019s Tools (level 3)\u201d to \u201cExpanded Alchemist\u2019s Lab\u201d as a sub-entry to the new alchemist\u2019s lab, and change the Bulk from 1 to 6 Change the alchemist\u2019s tools Price from 5 gp to 3 gp, and the Bulk from 2 to 1 Page 292: \u2691 The waterskin is always light Bulk, whether full or empty. Page 300: \u2691 The text on cantrips was confusing and implied that they might use spell slots, even though they don't. Change the second to last sentence in the first paragraph to \"If you're a prepared spellcaster, you can prepare a specific number of cantrips each day. You can't prepare a cantrip in a spell slot.\" Page 303: \u2691 In the Component Substitutions sidebar, replace the second paragraph with the following to avoid implying changes to action traits. Replace with: If you\u2019re a bard Casting a Spell from the occult tradition, you can usually play an instrument for spells requiring somatic or material components, as long as it takes at least one of your hands to do so. If you use an instrument, you don\u2019t need a spell component pouch or another hand free. You can usually also play an instrument for spells requiring verbal components, instead of speaking. - Also add a final one-sentence paragraph covering innate spells: Any character casting an innate spell can replace any material component with a somatic component. Pages 316\u2013407: \u2691 Remove the attack trait from the spells Abyssal plague, chill touch, death knell, ghoulish cravings, goblin pox, mariner\u2019s curse, outcast\u2019s curse, spider sting, spiritual guardian, spiritual weapon, savor the sting, touch of undeath (the cleric focus spell), and force bolt. Pages 316-407 and 573: \u2691 Damaging spells and items meant to harm PCs do way too much damage for your gear to survive if it could be targeted, so such spells almost never are supposed to be able to damage objects. A few target lines slipped by with \"creatures or objects.\" Remove the ability to target or damage objects from acid splash, acid arrow, eclipse burst, polar ray, sunburst, fire ray, moon beam, force bolt , and the horn of blasting . Limit hydraulic push to \"creatures and unattended objects.\" Page 318: \u2691 In animal messenger , change the duration to \u201csee text.\u201d Change the spell description to state that the spell ends after 24 hours or when a creature removes the attached object, whichever happens first. Page 318 and 400: \u2691 In antimagic field and storm lord, you can't exclude yourself from the emanation as you can for many other emanations, so change the area to explicitly states \"which affects you.\" Pages 322 and 390: \u2691 In the success entries for charm (page 322) and charming touch (page 390), replace references to Identify Magic with a reference to the Identifying Spells section on page 305. Page 330, 358, 377: \u2691 Add the attack trait to disintegrate, polar ray , and tanglefoot . Page 331: \u2691 Add the cantrip trait to disrupt undead . Page 336: \u2691 In enlarge , change the Heightened (6th) entry to read \u201cChoose either the 2nd-level or 4th-level version of this spell and apply its effects to 10 willing creatures.\u201d in case you want to make a large number of creatures Large but Huge would be too big for your circumstances. Page 338, 346, 379, 400: \u2691 Several sustained spells are meant to provide once per turn benefits when they are sustained, not be used multiple times per turn. In flaming sphere, implosion, unfathomable song, impaling briars , and storm lord add \"the first time you Sustain this Spell each round\" Page 339: \u2691 Once flesh to stone has completely petrified you, the spell ends but you still remain petrified, meaning you can't remove the effects with dispel magic or similar abilities that counteract active spells; you need stone to flesh. Change the last two sentences of the failure condition to read \"When a creature is unable to act due to the slowed condition from flesh to stone, the creature is permanently non-magically petrified. The spell ends if the creature is petrified or the slowed condition is removed.\" Page 343: \u2691 In harm , change the description of the 3-action version to read \u201cyou disperse negative energy\u201d instead of positive energy. Page 343: \u2691 Even if you aren't a humanoid, you too can be a hero. In heroism, remove \"humanoid\" from the targets line so it just reads \"1 creature\" Page 345: \u2691 Illusory disguise , a Perception check to disbelieve just happens, it isn't a free action, so change \"attempt a Perception check to disbelieve the spell as a free action\" to read \"attempt an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the spell.\" Page 348: \u2691 In light , change the Targets entry to read \u201c1 object of 1 Bulk or less, either unattended or possessed by you or a willing ally\u201d Page 349: \u2691 Some corner cases in magic fang and magic weapon . In magic fang, change the Targets entry to \u201c1 willing creature.\u201d Change the first sentence to \u201cChoose one of the target\u2019s unarmed attacks.\u201d Change the last sentence to \u201cThe unarmed attack becomes a +1 striking unarmed attack, gaining a +1 item bonus to attack rolls and increasing the number of damage dice to two if it had only one.\u201d This makes the spell less restrictive and more versatile. In magic weapon change the Targets entry to remove the word \"nonmagical\" so you can still cast it on a +1 weapon to get the extra striking die. Page 358: \u2691 Polar ray left out what happened on a critical hit with your spell attack roll. It should double the damage (but not the drained value) on a critical hit. Page 362: \u2691 Purple worm sting used to have both a spell attack roll and a Fortitude save, but in changing to only a save, some of the damage is now automatic and should be reduced. Reduce the piercing damage automatically taken from the spell to 3d6. Page 363: \u2691 The regenerate spell had an incorrect interaction with the doomed condition that would cause a doomed character to still die while regenerating. To handle that, instead of preventing a creature from progressing to dying 3, change it to \"its dying condition can't increase to a value that would kill it (this stops most creatures from going beyond dying 3).\" Page 370: \u2691 In sound burst , change the critical failure entry to read \u201cThe creature takes double damage, is deafened for 1 minute, and is stunned 1.\u201d since stunned doesn't have a duration. Page 373: \u2691 In spiritual weapon , you might not have a deity, particularly if you're an occult caster, so change it to manifest a \"a club, a dagger, or your deity's favored weapon.\" Page 377: \u2691 Telekinetic haul should work only on unattended objects, not objects in creatures' possessions. Page 377: \u2691 In telekinetic projectile , change the second sentence to read \u201cMake a spell attack roll against the target.\u201d It was accidentally missing the word \"spell\" before, meaning the attack roll wasn't explicitly classified as weapon, unarmed, or spell. Page 377: \u2691 In tangling creepers, instead of having the creepers make an unarmed attack using your spell attack modifier, change it to just say \"Make a melee spell attack roll against the target.\" Page 379: \u2691 In true target, the way the spell used its targets was confusing, and it wasn't clear it applied to more attacks. There are several changes to make this clear; Here is the final text with changes in bold: TRUE TARGET SPELL 7 DIVINATION FORTUNE PREDICTION Traditions arcane, occult Cast [one-action] verbal Range 60 feet; Targets 4 creatures Duration until the start of your next turn You delve into the possible futures of the next few seconds to understand all the ways your foe might avoid harm, then cast out a vision of that future to your allies. Designate a creature. The first time each target makes an attack roll against that creature during true target\u2019s duration, the attacker rolls twice and uses the better result. The attacker also ignores circumstance penalties to the attack roll and any flat check required due to the designated creature being concealed or hidden. Page 381: \u2691 In visions of danger, there's no description of what the Will save does, other than the critical success allowing you to disbelieve. It should be a basic Will save against the mental damage. Page 385: \u2691 In zealous conviction, add the emotion and mental traits. Page 390: \u2691 In charming touch, remove \"humanoid\" from the target line so you can charm any kind of creature that could find you attractive. Page 391: \u2691 In death\u2019s call, replace \u201cyour Wisdom modifier\u201d with \u201cyour spellcasting ability modifier\u201d so that champions aren't forced to use Wisdom. Page 393: \u2691 In healer's blessing, boost the additional healing from the base spell from 1 to 2. Page 399: \u2691 Replace the existing goodberry focus spell with the following. New Text: GOODBERRY FOCUS 1 Uncommon, Druid, Healing, Necromancy Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal Range touch; Targets 1 ripe berry Duration 10 minutes You imbue the target berry with the bounty of nature, turning it into a goodberry that can heal and sustain far beyond its normal capacity. A creature can eat the goodberry with an Interact action to regain 1d6+4 Hit Points. A berry not consumed during the duration withers away. Every six goodberries consumed gives as much nourishment as one square meal for a typical human. Heightened (+1) You can target an additional berry. A creature can consume any number of goodberries from the same casting with a single Interact action. Page 403: \u2691 Angelic halo should scale based on the level of the heal spell, not based on angelic halo's level. Remove the heightened entry and instead, replace the status bonus to healing from the spell with \"Allies in your halo\u2019s emanation who are healed by a heal spell gain a status bonus to Hit Points regained equal to double the heal spell\u2019s level.\" Page 409: \u2691 In the atone ritual, change the Heightened entry to \u201cHeightened (+1).\u201d Page 438: \u2691 Under Desna, change \u201c3rd: dream message\u201d to \u201c4th: fly.\u201d Page 438: \u2691 Under Iomedae, change \u201c2nd: see invisibility\u201d to \u201c2nd: enlarge.\u201d Page 441: \u2691 Add to the Whispering Way \u201cFollower Alignments LE, NE, CE\u201d Page 446: \u2691 Attack Rolls. There was some confusion as to whether skill checks with the attack trait (such as Grapple or Trip) are also attack rolls at the same time. They are not. To make this clear, add this sentence to the beginning of the definition of attack roll \"When you use a Strike action or make a spell attack, you attempt a check called an attack roll.\" To clarify the different rules elements involved: An attack is any check that has the attack trait . It applies and increases the multiple attack penalty. An attack roll is one of the core types of checks in the game (along with saving throws, skill checks, and Perception checks). They are used for Strikes and spell attacks, and traditionally target Armor Class. Some skill actions have the attack trait , specifically Athletics actions such as Grapple and Trip. You still make a skill check with these skills, not an attack roll. The multiple attack penalty applies on those skill actions as well. As it says later on in the definition of attack roll \"Striking multiple times in a turn has diminishing returns. The multiple attack penalty (detailed on page 446) applies to each attack after the first, whether those attacks are Strikes, special attacks like the Grapple action of the Athletics skill, or spell attack rolls.\" There is inaccurate language in the Multiple Attack Penalty section implying it applies only to attack rolls that will be receiving errata. Page 451: \u2691 Following the formulas for calculating damage rolls, add the sentence \u201cIf the combined penalties on an attack would reduce the damage to 0 or below, you still deal 1 damage.\u201d Resistances and the like can still reduce the damage to 0. Page 452: \u2691 At the end of the description of bleed damage, add \"Bleed damage ends automatically if you\u2019re healed to your full Hit Points.\" Page 453: \u2691 Weaknesses like \"salt\" and \"water\" weren't fully explained. At the beginning of the second paragraph in weakness, add \"If you have a weakness to something that doesn\u2019t normally deal damage, such as water, you take damage equal to the weakness value when touched or affected by it.\" Page 453 and 634: \u2691 In Nonlethal Attacks, nonlethal effects other than Strikes weren't explained directly, so at the end add \"Spells and other effects with the nonlethal trait that reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points knock the creature out instead of killing them\" On page 634, add the nonlethal trait \"An effect with this trait is nonlethal. Damage from a nonlethal effect knocks a creature out rather than killing it.\" Page 457: \u2691 In the Emanation section, add the following sentence to the end. \u201cUnless the text states otherwise, the creature creating an emanation effect chooses whether the creature at its center is affected.\u201d This means that you can cast spells like harm without damaging yourself. Page 459: \u2691 In the first bullet point under Knocked Out and Dying, change the sentence to \u201cYou immediately move your initiative position to directly before the turn in which you were reduced to 0 HP.\u201d This was originally intended, and prevents weird situations where you are knocked out by a reaction and die without having a chance for your allies to help you. Page 460: \u2691 Under Heroic Recovery, replace the first sentence with the following to align with other places in the text that discuss spending Hero Points. \u201cIf you have at least 1 Hero Point (page 467), you can spend all of your remaining Hero Points at the start of your turn or when your dying value would increase. You lose the dying condition entirely and stabilize with 0 Hit Points. You don\u2019t gain the wounded condition or increase its value from losing the dying condition in this way, but if you already had that condition, you don\u2019t lose it or decrease its value.\u201d Page 461: \u2691 Add a new section after Temporary Hit Points: Fast Healing and Regeneration Some abilities grant fast healing, and some creatures have regeneration. A creature with either ability regains the listed amount of Hit Points each round at the beginning of its turn. A creature with regeneration has additional benefits. Its dying condition can\u2019t increase to a value that would kill it (this stops most creatures from going beyond dying 3) as long as its regeneration is active. If it takes damage of a type listed in the regeneration entry, its regeneration deactivates until the end of its next turn, including against the triggering damage. Page 481: \u2691 Retraining. It wasn't clear how long it took to retrain spells in a spell repertoire, but it should take just 1 week. Add \". Some, like changing a spell in your spell repertoire, take a week.\" to retraining class features. Page 421: \u2691 Disabling a Hazard. How to run disabling a hazard with skills other than Thievery wasn't completely clear. Add \"Like using Disable a Device, using these skills to disable a trap is a 2-action activity with the same degrees of success, though the activity might have different traits determined by the GM.\" Page 535: \u2691 Craft Requirements. Add text about upgrading an item from a lower-level version into a higher-level version. \"The GM might allow you to Craft a permanent item from a lower-level version of the same item as an upgrade. For example, you might upgrade a bag of holding from a type I to a type II bag, but you couldn\u2019t upgrade a clear spindle aeon stone into an orange prism aeon stone. The cost for this upgrade is the full difference in Price between the items, and the Crafting check uses a DC for the item\u2019s new level.\" Page 537 and 583: \u2691 Shadow and slick runes. Since a character can't actually use those runes unless they have a +1 armor first (a 5th level item), move the items from 3rd level to 5th level when they become usable (keeping the price from the original version, even though it's unusually low for a 5th level item). Page 542 and 548: \u2691 The true elixir of life's price is incorrect. Change it to 8,000 gp. Page 544: \u2691 The example in the splash trait is confusing. Replace it with this clearer version of the example \"For example, if you throw a lesser acid flask and hit your target, that creature takes 1 acid damage, 1d6 persistent acid damage, and 1 acid splash damage. All other creatures within 5 feet of it take 1 acid splash damage. On a critical hit, the target takes 2 acid damage and 2d6 persistent acid damage, but the splash damage is still 1. If you miss, the target and all creatures within 5 feet take only 1 splash damage. If you critically fail, no one takes any damage.\" Page 546: \u2691 Under the Mutagens heading, to explain how to handle the counteracting between mutagens, add the following sentence to the end of the second paragraph. \u201cMutagens are polymorph effects (page 301), and a subsequent polymorph effect attempts to counteract an existing effect; the counteract check for a mutagen uses the item\u2019s level and a modifier equal to the that level\u2019s DC \u2013 10, as found on Table 10\u20135: DCs by Level (page 503).\u201d Page 548: \u2691 To make it clearer that elixir of life only works on living creatures due to the healing trait, change the first sentence to \"Elixirs of life accelerate a living creature\u2019s natural healing processes and immune system.\" Page 549: \u2691 Quicksilver mutagen's \"ranged attack rolls\" was meant to apply to ranged weapon attack rolls and ranged unarmed attack rolls, but it makes sense to apply to Dexterity-based melee attack rolls using finesse. Change \"ranged attack rolls\" to \"Dexterity-based attack rolls.\" Page 550: \u2691 Under Method of Exposure, in the Injury section, change the first sentence to read \u201cAn injury poison is activated by applying it to a weapon or ammunition, and it affects the target of the first Strike made using the poisoned item.\u201d This explicitly allows you to poison ammunition as well as weapons. Pages 551\u2013554: \u2691 Injury poisons should require 2 actions to apply rather than 3, allowing you to draw a poison and apply it to a weapon on the same turn. Change the Activate entries for the following poisons from a [three-actions] glyph to a [two\u2011actions] glyph: belladonna, black adder venom, giant centipede venom, giant scorpion venom, giant wasp venom, graveroot, hunting spider venom, lethargy poison, purple worm venom, shadow essence, and wyvern poison. Page 551: \u2691 Deathcap powder should be held in 1 hand, like other ingested poisons, not held in 2 hands. Page 566: \u2691 In dispelling sliver, add \u201c(counteract modifier +29)\u201d to the end of the first paragraph of the effect. Page 573: \u2691 In the decanter of endless water, add a usage entry of 2 hands and a Bulk entry of L. Page 574: \u2691 Maestro's instrument should have DCs for the charm effects, DC 27 for the moderate version and DC 38 for the greater version. Page 584: \u2691 In the grievous rune entry for a spear, change \u201cenfeebled\u201d to \u201cclumsy\u201d to match the spear\u2019s critical specialization effect. Page 586\u2013587: \u2691 In mithral shield, change the Bulk entries for the standard-grade mithral shield and the high-grade mithral shield from \u201c1\u201d to \u201cL.\u201d Page 587: \u2691 Arrow-catching shield. This shield had a built in usage frequency based on being fairly fragile that worked in the playtest rules for shields, but switching from dents to HP, the shield became too easily destroyed and needs to offer more protection. Increase the basic shield statistics to Hardness 10, HP 60, BT 30 and add a frequency of once per minute on the activation. Page 588: \u2691 Forge warden's durability is too low. Increase its basic shield statistics to Hardness 10, HP 40, BT 20. Page 592: \u2691 Under Staves, change the fourth sentence to \u201cMany staves can be found in multiple versions, with more powerful versions that contain more spells\u2014such a staff always contains the spells of all lower-level versions, in addition to the spells listed in its own entry.\u201d This removes the erroneous mention of holding more charges. In preparing a staff, change the second sentence to \"When you do so, that staff gains a number of charges equal to the level of your highest spell slot. You don\u2019t need to expend any spells to add charges in this way.\" This makes it clear how many charges you gain if you have only a few low level spell slots but have a cantrip or focus spell. Finally, in attacking with a staff, add \"Staves are also staff weapons (page 280). They can be etched with fundamental runes but not property runes. This doesn\u2019t alter any of their spellcasting abilities.\" since staves are specific weapons, with the staff abilities as the additional abilities. Page 594: \u2691 Greater staff of necromancy has enervation, a spell that's in Advanced Player's Guide instead of this book. Replace it with a 4th level vampiric touch. Page 597: \u2691 Wands become broken when you overcharge them and succeed at the flat check, and you need to know their statistics to Repair them. While they use the normal statistics for a thin item of their composition, it makes sense to call that out. At the end of Varying Statistics, add \"A wand has the normal Hardness, BT, and HP of a thin item of its material (page 577).\" Page 602: \u2691 In the entry for greater storm flash, add a spell DC of 38 to the end of the last sentence, as the greater form of an item should increase the DC to a competitive one for its level. Page 604: \u2691 Under Companion Items, replace the third sentence with \u201cNormally these are the only items a companion can use. Other items may qualify, at the GM\u2019s discretion, but an animal can never Activate an Item.\u201d This makes the rules clearer than before, and allows the GM to opt into adding more items. Page 612: \u2691 Healer's gloves' activation was unclear as to whether it was a healing effect. Change the activation effect to the following: \"You can soothe the wounds of a willing, living, adjacent creature, restoring 2d6+7 Hit Points to that creature. This is a positive healing effect. You can\u2019t harm undead with this healing.\" Page 618: \u2691 In the definition for the broken condition, change the second sentence to \u201cAn object is broken when damage has reduced its Hit Points to equal or less than its Broken Threshold.\u201d This matches the definition of broken on page 272 (the inconsistency before was what happened when its HP were exactly equal to the Broken Threshold). Page 620, 631, and 454: \u2691 In the definition of fatigued, the intention is that it prevents the exploration tactics you take while traveling or exploring an area, but you can still stop and Refocus, Treat Wounds, and so on. Change the last sentence to \"You can\u2019t use exploration activities performed while traveling, such as those on pages 479\u2013480.\" Pages 620\u2013623: \u2691 In the definitions for the friendly, helpful, hostile, indifferent, and unfriendly conditions, change the first sentence to read \u201cThis condition reflects a creature\u2019s disposition toward a particular character, and only supernatural effects (like a spell) can impose these conditions on player characters.\u201d This continues to reflect the fact that mundane skills can't influence a PC's attitude (unless the player wishes to change it to reflect the other character's persuasive ability) while allowing magic like charm to do so. Page 621: \u2691 The prone condition said you could Take Cover to gain cover against ranged attacks, but it should say you gain Greater Cover. When combined with still being flat-footed, it allows you to hunker down for a net of 2 more AC against ranged attacks. Page 621: \u2691 Persistent damage sidebar. Clarifying Assisted Recovery, at the end of the first paragraph, change the last sentence to \"This allows you to attempt an extra flat check immediately, but only once per round.\" and add the bullet point \"\u2022 The action to help might require a skill check or another roll to determine its effectiveness.\" Remove Administer First Aid as an example of assisted recovery, as it's a separate action. Pathfinder Core Rulebook Errata (Part 2) \u2691 Page 71: \u2691 Alchemists should have proficiency in medium armor to make things easier for mutagenists who pursue higher Strength and lower Dexterity. Add training in medium armor to their initial proficiencies as well as to their 13th and 19th level armor expertise and mastery class features. Page 72-79: \u2691 Alchemist DC scaling is highly dependent on the feat Powerful Alchemy, so we decided to make it an automatic class feature instead to free up more feats. Add powerful alchemy to the class features at 5th level, and remove it from the list of alchemist class feats. Page 73: \u2691 Alchemists at low levels don't have enough reagents to make more than a very small number of items, whereas at higher levels they can make significantly more. To help make those reagents last longer at 1st through 4th levels, add a limited version of the Field Discovery class feature at 1st level. \"Your research field adds a number of formulas to your formula book; these are your signature items. When using a batch of infused reagents to create your signature items using advanced alchemy, you create three items instead of two. Each time you gain a level, you can swap one of your signature items with another formula in your formula book. This new signature item must be on your research field\u2019s list of possible signature items.\" Page 75: \u2691 Alchemical Alacrity lets you make three alchemical items, but you can't hold all three, so it's unclear what happens to the third one. Add to the end \"and you automatically stow one of these new items as you create them.\" Page 75: \u2691 In perpetual infusions, \"bullheaded mutagen\" should say \"serene mutagen.\" Page 89: \u2691 Raging Athlete. The wording has been adjusted to prevent unintended interactions with other abilities while keeping the same benefits. Change the text to \"Physical obstacles can\u2019t hold back your fury. While you are raging, you gain a climb Speed and swim Speed equal to your land Speed and the DC of High Jumps and Long Jumps decreases by 10. Your distance for a vertical Leap increases to 5 feet vertically, and your distance for a horizontal Leap increases to 15 feet if your Speed is at least 15 feet and to 20 feet if your Speed is at least 30 feet.\" Page 91: \u2691 Sudden Leap is missing the two-action icon from the fighter version, leaving the action cost unstated. Add in the two action icon. Pages 99-103: Various bard feats shouldn't have the \"focus pool\" prerequisite. If you somehow take them without a focus pool (typically via multiclassing), you gain a focus pool, as normal for taking your first feat that grants a focus spell. Pages 102, 201, 211: \u2691 In Quickened Casting, change the restriction to \"If your next action is to cast a Classname cantrip or a spell that is at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level Classname spell slot you have\" inserting bard, sorcerer, or wizard as appropriate. This wording change makes it clear how to handle situations where you have a cantrip or focus spell at a different spell level than your highest spell slot. - Class Chapter (all spellcasting classes): Change the definition of cantrips to say \"A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, which equals the highest-level of Classname spell slot you have.\" filling in the appropriate class name. This removes the ambiguities around the cantrip level of a non-spellcaster vs a multiclass spellcaster. Pages 222-231: \u2691 In the multiclass spellcaster Breadth feats, change \"for each spell level other than your two highest spell levels\" to \"for each spell level other than your two highest Classname spell slots.\" inserting the appropriate class. This makes it clear what to do if you are a spellcaster multiclassing in another spellcasting class (or potentially multiclassing in multiple spellcasting classes). Page 630: \u2691 In curses, add \"Effects with this trait can be removed only by effects that specifically target curses.\" This makes it clear that you need to use spells like remove curse to remove a curse, even one put in place by a spell, as opposed to dispel magic. Pages 337, 403, 405: \u2691 In feeblemind, celestial brand, and jealous hex, make it clear that they are applying a curse. Page 634: \u2691 Add the olfactory trait from the Bestiary to the Glossary and Index \"An olfactory effect can affect only creatures that can smell it. This applies only to olfactory parts of the effect, as determined by the GM.\" Pages 629\u2013633: \u2691 In the definitions of the chaotic, evil, good, and lawful traits, remove the last sentence. Creatures can use abilities of an alignment without matching that alignment, but they might be anathema or change a creature\u2019s alignment over time with repeated use. Page 637: \u2691 In the definition of the summoned trait, add this section to deal with summoned creatures creating more creatures without using summoning \"A summoned creature can't control any spawn or other creatures generated from it, and such creatures return to their unaltered state (usually a corpse in the case of spawn) once the summoned creature is gone. If it's unclear what this state would be, the GM decides.\" Pathfinder Core Rulebook Errats Part 3 \u2691 Page 113: \u2691 The champion's Quick Block feat accidentally had a different name than fighter Quick Shield Block. Change the name to Quick Shield Block to make it clear this is the same feat in two different classes, much like Blind Fight, Quick Draw, or Sudden Charge. Additionally, the errata for the 2nd Printing from Blade of Justice correctly removed the restriction making the feat paladin-only but should have still kept a prerequisites of tenets of good. Add that prerequisite back. Pages 118, 130, 204: \u2691 In the wizard, change the spells you can select at 1st level to \"You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list (page 307) or from other arcane spells you gain access to. \" to match the witch. The cleric and druid are slightly more complicated, as there was some confusion as to how clerics and druids learn new spells (they use Learn a Spell). Change cleric to say they prepare their spells \"from the common spells on the divine spell list (page 309) or from other divine spells to which you gain access and learn via Learn a Spell.\" and druid to follow suit. This will cause clerics and druids to have an ever-expanding list of options, so if this becomes unmanageable compared to other prepared spellcasters, consider either restricting to a smaller and more manageable subset of spells like the other prepared spellcasters or implementing strategies like having a few default lists prepared in advance. Pages 119-120: \u2691 The 2nd printing errata accidentally missed the cleric when it came to giving expert proficiency in unarmed attacks. Add to both the cloistered cleric and warpriest doctrines that they gain expert proficiency in unarmed attacks in addition to their deity's favored weapon. They still only get the critical specialization effect for their deity's favored weapon. Page 151: \u2691 The Knockdown feat's wording made it ambiguous whether you were actually Tripping, which left it uncertain whether you apply any special effects and requirements related to the Trip action. To make it clear, change it to say \"If you do and your Strike hits, instead of rolling a check for your Trip attempt, you automatically apply the critical success effect of a Trip.\" Page 153: \u2691 Fighter's Boundless Reprisals should specify you use the reactions for fighter reactions. At the end, add that you can use the extra reactions \"for any reaction from a fighter feat or class feature.\" Page 164: \u2691 Monk's Mountain Quake doesn't list which DC to use. While it's technically fine not to include, as class DC is the default for a class feat, given that monks might also have a spell DC, most monk feats indicate that they use class DC. Change to \"with a basic Fortitude save against your class DC.\" Pages 165, 331, 391, 395, 402, 406, 407: \u2691 Several auras were missing the aura trait. Add it to monk's Enlightened Presence feat and the divine aura, destructive aura, protector's sphere, angelic halo, dread aura, and protective ward spells Page 174: \u2691 The ranger camouflage feat's wording didn't explain what it was meant to do correctly and thus didn't work like camouflage and let you sneak around without any cover or concealment. Change the last sentence to \"In natural terrain, you can Hide and Sneak even without cover or being concealed.\" Page 177: \u2691 Ranger's Impossible Volley was missing the flourish and open traits. Add them. Page 181: \u2691 Rogue's sneak attack accidentally left out ranged unarmed attacks, like leshy's seedpod. Change to \"If you Strike a creature that has the flat-footed condition with an agile or finesse melee weapon, an agile or finesse unarmed attack, a ranged weapon attack, or a ranged unarmed attack, you deal an extra 1d6 precision damage. For a ranged attack with a thrown melee weapon, that weapon must also be agile or finesse.\" Page 201: \u2691 Sorcerer's Magic Sense should add the trait corresponding to the tradition of spells the sorcerer casts. Page 205: \u2691 The Drain Bonded Item is missing language indicating you need to have the item on your person, so add \", as long as the item is on your person.\" to the end of the first sentence. Page 214, 217: \u2691 Animal companions don't technically ever say they are animals, even though some later companions that aren't animals mention they have the \"dragon trait instead of the animal trait\" for instance. Therefore, change to say \"Your animal companion has the animal and minion traits.\" Secondly, the nimble animal companion had an error in converting from the playtest and should not have kept a higher proficiency with unarmored defense, which put it roughly 4 AC above other animal companions and in some cases higher than a PC can have. This is a carryover from when proficiency only gave +1 and the savage companion used to have higher proficiency in unarmed attacks while the nimble companion had higher in unarmored defense. Change it so it raises just Acrobatics to expert, putting it back in parallel with savage raising Athletics. This also adjusts Ambusher, Daredevil, and all similar specializations in other books that raise unarmored proficiency: in all those specializations, remove the part where it raises unarmored proficiency to master if the companion was nimble. Page 216: \u2691 The Horse companion's support benefit mistakenly used the word attack when it meant to use Strike. Change to read \"Your horse adds momentum to your charge. Until the start of your next turn, if you moved at least 10 feet on the action before your Strike, add a circumstance bonus to damage for that Strike equal to twice the number of damage dice. If your weapon already has the jousting weapon trait, increase the trait\u2019s damage bonus by 2 per die instead.\" Page 231: \u2691 The wizard multiclass archetype didn't let you pick a school with the dedication, meaning you have to take Arcane School Spell to get some wizard feats, unlike for instance sorcerer, bard, and druid, who choose a bloodline, muse, or order but gain no abilities. Change wizard dedication so you can choose an arcane school but gain no abilities from it. Then in Arcane School Spell, you don't choose a school, and you gain the school spell from the school you already chose. Page 247: \u2691 The Lore skill was ambiguous when addressing inappropriate choices of Lore as to whether those subcategories were allowed. Change to make it clear they are not: \"For instance, you couldn't choose Magic Lore to recall the breadth of knowledge about magic covered by Arcana, Nature, Occultism, and Religion, or Adventuring Lore to give you all the information an adventurer needs, or Planar Lore to gain all the information spread across various skills and subcategories such as Heaven Lore.\" Page 266: \u2691 Scare to Death's kill chances wound up being too high compared to its action cost and other abilities. Change the critical success to say \"The target must attempt at a Fortitude save against your Intimidation DC. On a critical failure, it dies. On any other result, it becomes frightened 2 and is fleeing for 1 round. The critical failure effect has the death trait.\" Then remove the death trait from the feat itself, as creatures immune to death effects can still take the other consequences. Pages 301, 634, 637: \u2691 The minion and summoned traits are out of date. Change to match Secrets of Magic . Minions are creatures that directly serve another creature. A creature with this trait can use only 2 actions per turn, doesn\u2019t have reactions, and can\u2019t act when it\u2019s not your turn. Your minion acts on your turn in combat, once per turn, when you spend an action to issue it commands. For an animal companion, you Command an Animal; for a minion that\u2019s a spell or magic item effect, like a summoned minion, you Sustain a Spell or Sustain an Activation; if not otherwise specified, you issue a verbal command as a single action with the auditory and concentrate traits. If given no commands, minions use no actions except to defend themselves or to escape obvious harm. If left unattended for long enough, typically 1 minute, mindless minions usually don\u2019t act, animals follow their instincts, and sapient minions act how they please. A minion can\u2019t control other creatures. A creature called by a spell or effect gains the summoned trait. A summoned creature can\u2019t summon other creatures, create things of value, or cast spells that require a cost. It has the minion trait. If it tries to Cast a Spell of equal or higher level than the spell that summoned it, it overpowers the summoning magic, causing its own spell to fail and the summon spell to end. Otherwise, the summoned creature uses the standard abilities for a creature of its kind. It generally attacks your enemies to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with it, you can attempt to command it, but the GM determines the degree to which it follows your commands. Immediately when you finish Casting the Spell, the summoned creature uses its 2 actions for that turn. A spawn or other creature generated from a summoned creature returns to its unaltered state (usually a corpse in the case of spawn) once the summoned creature is gone. If it\u2019s unclear what this state would be, the GM decides. Summoned creatures can be banished by various spells and effects. They are automatically banished if reduced to 0 Hit Points or if the spell that called them ends. Pages 316, 317, 318, 330, 332, 335, 347, 353, 354, 358: \u2691 In aerial form, animal form, avatar, dinosaur form, dragon form, elemental form, insect form, monstrosity form, nature incarnate, plant form, change \"only attacks you can use\" to \"only attacks you can Strike with.\" You can still use non-Strike attacks like Grapple and Trip as normal. 317, 352, 359, 385: In alter reality, miracle, primal phenomenon, and wish, the spells should be able to automatically duplicate spell slot spells (not rituals or focus spells), and only ones to which you have access in case your group was explicitly restricting access to certain spells for thematic reasons, difficulty of running the spells, or any other reason. Change the first two bullet points to read like the following, with wish as an example: \"\u2022 Duplicate any spell from the arcane list of 9th level or lower to which you have access. \u2022 Duplicate any spell from another spell list of 7th level or lower to which you have access.\" Page 324: \u2691 Chromatic wall's blue wall stops sound and correctly indicated that it blocked auditory effects but failed to mention it blocked sonic effects too. Add sonic to the list of effects it blocks. This change also adjusts spells like prismatic wall that depend on chromatic wall. Pages 326, 329, 333, 335, 348, 349, 360, 366, 369, 371, 373: \u2691 A number of spells accidentally had a duration of 24 hours or 1 day instead of \"until the next time you make your daily preparations.\" In general, nearly all beneficial spells should have the latter duration so you can check and keep them active each morning, so that for instance your awesome mansion doesn't vanish and spit out the guests once a day until you make another. These are contingency, dimensional lock, dream message, energy aegis, lock, magnificent mansion, private sanctum, sanctified ground, shrink item, spell immunity, and status. Page 330: \u2691 Disintegrate technically didn't mention what to do on a hit or miss with the spell attack roll. Add \"On a hit\" before \"you deal 12d10 damage\" to make it clear you need to hit. Page 340, 369, 562, 574: \u2691 In the last errata document, we removed some of the restrictions on spells like magic weapon requiring you cast them on a nonmagical weapon, but we missed a few. In ghostly weapon and shillelagh, change the target to remove the requirement that it's nonmagical. This requires an extra line in ghostly weapon to explain what happens if you already have the maximum number of property runes for a magical weapon. \"If the weapon is magical and already has the maximum number of property runes, the wielder can choose one to suppress to gain ghost touch.\" Then change the items primeval mistletoe and oil of potency as well to remove the restriction, as they mimic effects of these kinds of spells. Page 351: \u2691 In meteor swarm, there is some ambiguity on how the multiple meteors work when dealing with larger creatures. To make it clear, change the text to say \"The meteors\u2019 central 10-foot bursts can\u2019t overlap, and a creature attempts only one saving throw against the spell no matter how many overlapping explosions it's caught in, and they can take each type of damage once once.\" Page 356: \u2691 Pest form has a couple of errors. First, increase the land Speed it grants to 20 feet, as 10 feet is too slow to effectively scout while appearing to be a normal animal. Second, unlike other battle forms, it lacks the text directly explaining what to do about Strikes. Pest form is a 1st level scouting spell and is not meant for attacking, so explicitly change to \"While in this form, you gain the animal trait, and you can\u2019t make Strikes.\" Page 376: \u2691 In synaptic pulse, remove the extraneous range listing, and change the second sentence to say \"Each enemy in the area must attempt a Will save.\" to match the first sentence. Page 387: \u2691 Both inspire heroics and lingering composition should have the metamagic trait. Add it to both focus spells. Page 405: \u2691 Undeath's Blessing's Failure effect was inconsistent with the Success effect. The Failure effect (or effect for those who choose to forego the save) should be \"For the duration, harm and heal spells treat the creature as undead. In addition, harm spells gain a +2 status bonus to the Hit Points restored to the target.\" Page 446: \u2691 While there are numerous places in the Core Rulebook that indicate that non-Strike attack actions like Shove and Trip take a multiple attack penalty on their checks, in one spot in the definition of multiple attack penalty, it mentions that you take your multiple attack penalty on attack rolls. This caused some confusion as to whether it applies to skill checks or other rolls you might make as part of an attack action despite the other references, so to clear that up, change \"attack roll\" to \"check\" in both places. Page 451, 621: \u2691 There are a lot of questions about persistent damage. Check the CRB FAQ for more information, but the one thing that we're adding in errata is explicitly stating \" Like normal damage, it can be doubled or halved based on the results of an attack roll or saving throw.\" Page 476: \u2691 Flanking was ambiguous on what happened if you made a ranged attack while within reach of a foe you are flanking. To make it clear that only melee attacks benefit from flanking, change the second sentence to read \"A creature is flat-footed (taking a \u20132 circumstance penalty to AC) to melee attacks from creatures that are flanking it.\" Page 500: \u2691 Since people have been specifically asking about Assurance with respect to downtime, after \"If something could apply constantly, or so often that it might as well be constant, it\u2019s more likely to be used for downtime checks;\" we added \"for instance Assurance could apply.\" to show that it's something that could apply constantly. Page 557: \u2691 Electric eelskin armor accidentally listed a spell DC for shocking grasp and not a spell attack modifier. It should have a spell attack modifier of +19. Page 557, 600: \u2691 Specific magic armor and weapons say you can't etch a property rune, but you also can't remove a property rune or transfer a property rune to or from a specific armor or weapon. Explicitly add those restrictions to the definitions of each. Page 565: \u2691 The intro to Affixing a Talisman said you can't affix more than one talisman to the same item, which is slightly incorrect. Change it to match the Affix a Talisman action just below, which says you can, but you just deactivate them all so it's usually a bad idea. Pages 565, 597: \u2691 You only need to learn a single 1st level formula to Craft any scroll or any magic wand (though specialty wands each require their own formulas as normal). Add \"You only need to learn one 1st-level formula to Craft a magic wand.\" and parallel text for scrolls. Page 585: \u2691 In the wounding rune, given that persistent damage doubles on a critical hit, changing the 1d6 to 1d12 instead of doubling would actually make it deal less damage on average. Thus, remove the part about changing to 1d12 damage on a critical hit. Instead, the wounding rune's bleed damage doubles as normal for persistent damage. Page 588: \u2691 Reflecting shield's counteract modifier had a typo listing it at +40. It should be +30. Page 614: \u2691 The ring of lies was erroneously missing its frequency entry for the activation. It should be once per day, as per the usual guidelines for a spell activation in an item. Page 614: \u2691 The greater ring of maniacal devices has a price that is drastically incorrect for a level 18 item. It should be 21,000 gp. The incorrect price is also listed in the treasure tables. Page 616: \u2691 Replace robe of the archmagi's color scheme with a more in-world pattern using gold for good, red for evil, and light blue for neutral. This scheme is patterned after gold dragons (the strongest metallic dragon), red dragons (the strongest chromatic dragon), and cloud dragons (the strongest, and all true neutral primal dragon) respectively. Advanced Player's Guide Errata \u2691 Page 23: \u2691 The Rat Magic feat in ratfolk was missing the ratfolk trait. Add the trait. Pages 38, 42, 44: \u2691 A few ancestry feats with uncommon spells were erroneously not listed as uncommon. These are duskwalker's Boneyard' Call, dwarf's Stonegate, and gnome's Homeward Bound. Page 45: \u2691 The Kneecap feat doesn't list the duration of the penalty. It lasts for 1 round. Page 74: \u2691 The flame augur sample character had burning hands before level 4, when they would have been able to take Divine Access. Change it to fear. Pages 80, 104, 105, 257: \u2691 Several places mentioned \"your highest level spell\" when they should have mentioned \"your highest level spell slot.\" This includes the witch feat Siphon Power, the Quickened Casting feat in both oracle and witch (which standardizes it with the same change in the Core Rulebook Quickened Casting feats) and candle of invocation. Page 95: \u2691 In witch initial proficiencies, the spell proficiencies say the tradition of magic is determined by the witch's first lesson, but that's a holdover from the playtest. It should say the tradition is determined by the witch's patron. Page 101: \u2691 Witch's Widen Spell accidentally had the concentrate trait instead of manipulate like everyone else. Change it to manipulate. Page 111: \u2691 In Sunder Spell, there's no guidance on what it takes to hit something like a wall that doesn't have a listed AC. Add \"\u201cIf you're targeting something that doesn't have an AC listed, its AC is usually 10 against this Strike for targets that are very easy to hit, like a wall, or a different AC determined by the GM.\u201d Page 146: \u2691 There's been some confusion over whether an independent familiar can use abilities that require a command, like valet, or whether the independent ability overrides the normal rules for mounted combat. To make clear that neither is the case, add \"This doesn\u2019t work with valet or similar abilities that require a command, if you\u2019re capable of riding your familiar, or similar situations.\" Page 161: \u2691 Beastmaster's Call was missing its school. It should be conjuration. Page 163: \u2691 In bounty hunter's Keep Pace, in the first sentence, the word \"escape\" should not be capitalized. It's just talking about escaping in general, not the Escape action. Pages 161 and 193: \u2691 The archetype focus spells should be uncommon. This includes the beastmaster's beastmaster's trance spell and the shadowdancer's dance of darkness, shadow illusion, and shadow jump spells. Page 168-169: \u2691 Dragon disciple has a couple errors. First, the dedication feat should make you trained in arcane spell DCs and spell attack rolls, in case you need that training when picking up the later feats that give you arcane focus spells. Second, the armor bonus from Scales of the Dragon feat should change to match the errata to Animal Skin and Mountain Stance in the Core Rulebook. The final text of that section is as follows: \"When you\u2019re unarmored, the scales give you a +2 item bonus to AC with a Dexterity cap of +3. The item bonus to AC from Scales of the Dragon is cumulative with armor potency runes on your explorer's clothing, mage armor, and bracers of armor.\" Page 172: \u2691 Remove the paragraph from the first printing that begins, \"If you already cast spells from spell slots, you gain one additional cantrip from that tradition.\" If you're already a spellcaster, you use your normal allotment of spells for eldritch archer abilities and don't gain more spells. Page 191: \u2691 Sentinel Archetype's Armor Specialist feat had a stray Skill trait due to an error. Remove it. Page 208: \u2691 The Contacts feat incorrectly refers to Underworld Connections, which is the old name of the feat Criminal Connections. Replace with the correct name. Page 214, 222, 223, 228, 232, 237: \u2691 Animated assault, mad monkeys, quench, hymn of healing, interstellar void, and steal shadow all need to say their effects occur \"The first time each round you Sustain the Spell\" due to clarifications in the Core Rulebook on Sustaining spells. Meanwhile, aqueous orb is in the opposite situation because it was meant to allow effects from multiple Sustains already. Remove \"Unlike most spells\" Page 220-221: \u2691 Ice storm and lightning storm had some issues, with potentially-intense effects limited to a way-too-small area. The big change was that they both updated the area from 5-foot radius to 20-foot radius, but there's a few adjustments to keep them on track with other similar spells with the new area. The full adjusted text is as follows: Ice Storm Spell 4 Cold Evocation Traditions arcane, primal Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal Range 120 feet; Area 20-foot burst Saving Throw basic Reflex; Duration sustained up to 1 minute You create a gray storm cloud that pelts creatures with an icy deluge. When you Cast the Spell, a burst of magical hail deals 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 2d8 cold damage to each creature in the area below the cloud (basic Reflex save). Snow and sleet continue to rain down in the area for the remainder of the spell\u2019s duration, making the area difficult terrain. Any creature that ends its turn in the storm takes 2 cold damage. If you Cast this Spell outdoors, you can create two non-overlapping clouds instead of one. As normal, if a big creature is in both clouds, it still only takes the initial damage once and the continuing damage once per turn. Heightened (+2) The initial bludgeoning damage and cold damage increase by 1d8 each, and the cold damage creatures take at the end of their turns increases by 1. **Lightning Storm Spell 5 Electricity Evocation Traditions primal Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal Range 120 feet; Area 20-foot burst Saving Throw basic Reflex; Duration sustained up to 1 minute You create a black, rumbling storm cloud and call down one lightning bolt within the spell\u2019s area. The bolt is a vertical line from the top of the storm cloud to the ground below, dealing 4d12 electricity damage to creatures in the line (basic Reflex save). On subsequent rounds, the first time you Sustain the Spell each round, you can call another lightning bolt within the area. If you Cast this Spell outdoors, you can create two non-overlapping clouds instead of one, though you can still call down only one bolt per turn. Heightened (+2) The damage of each bolt increases by 1d12. Page 226: \u2691 Threefold Aspect is missing its components. It should have material, somatic, and verbal components. Page 230: \u2691 Ancestral form says you can \"Sustain a Spell\" but should say you can \"Sustain Spells\" to make it clearer that you are not limited to Sustaining a single spell. Page 233: \u2691 Tempest form prevents you from using manipulate actions but then offers several you can do. Add \"except those granted by this spell\" to the restriction on manipulate actions. Page 234: \u2691 Heal companion's 2-action version was missing the somatic component. It should have both somatic and verbal components. Page 248: \u2691 The ranged weapons had slight errors in their table entries. The bola should be an uncommon weapon. Meanwhile, the daikyu should have reload 0 (not --) and should be propulsive. Page 249: \u2691 Detective's Kit, like the Core Rulebook kits, should need 1 hand if you're wearing it and 2 otherwise. Change to match Core Rulebook. Page 250: \u2691 The table erroneously lists the walking cauldron as a held item, but it isn't in its entry. It should be \"Other.\" Page 255: \u2691 Timeless salts mentions the non-existing spell speak with dead, but it should say talking corpse instead. Page 265: \u2691 Wand of hopeless night's 4th-level spell type should increase the DC to 27. Page 266: \u2691 Update the curse trait to match the newest version in the Core Rulebook. \"curse (trait) A curse is an effect that places some long-term affliction on a creature. Curses are always magical and are typically the result of a spell or trap. Effects with this trait can be removed only by effects that specifically target curses. 457\u2013458\" Page 268-270: \u2691 As mentioned in the Bestiary 2 errata, there were some small changes to the minion and summoned traits to better handle situations where minions might get control of more creatures and create a cascade. In the minion trait, at the end add \"A minion can\u2019t control other creatures.\" In the summoned trait, remove the specification that the spell summoning them must be conjuration (as some necromancy spells summon creatures, for instance), and remove the sentence saying they can't control any spawn they create, since the minion trait now already includes that restriction and it's redundant to include it again in summoned. Pathfinder Bestiary 2 Errata \u2691 Page 19: \u2691 In the ankou's skills, change Bluff to Deception. Page 34: \u2691 The basidirond\u2019s hallucinogenic cloud is missing all its traits. These should be incapacitation, mental, and poison. Page 57: \u2691 The culdewen should be uncommon, and several abilities didn't work quite right, making it unnecessarily difficult for PCs to escape the culdewen's hook. Add the uncommon trait. In Hooked, change \u201cThe fish hook can be removed only if a creature spends an Interact action and succeeds at a DC 25 Athletics check to pull it free.\u201d to \u201cThe fish hook can be removed if a creature Escapes (DC 25), pulling it free. In Land the Fish, after \u201cOn a success, the creature is restrained by the culdewen.\u201d add \u201cEscaping from the restrained condition (DC 25) also allows a creature to remove the hook. Page 61: \u2691 Change the thanadaemon's Focus Gaze\u2019s effect to say \u201cThe thanadaemon glares at a single creature they can see within 30 feet. If the target wasn\u2019t already frightened, they must immediately attempt a DC 33 Will save against the thanadaemon's terrifying gaze. If the target was already frightened, they must attempt a DC 33 Will save or become fleeing for 1d4 rounds; this second effect has the incapacitation trait. After attempting its save, the creature is temporarily immune to this ability until the start of the thanadaemon's next turn.\u201d Page 70: \u2691 Add the uncommon trait to the Denizen of Leng. Page 93: \u2691 The Giant Cockroach Swarm is listed as Small, but should be Large Page 99: \u2691 The drainberry bush should have been listed as uncommon. Add the uncommon trait. Page 184: \u2691 The followers of fate religion should have the 3rd level spell threefold aspect instead of the 2nd level spell web. Page 241: \u2691 The skaveling is missing its undead immunities. Add \u201cImmunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, unconscious.\u201d Page 248: \u2691 The specter's Spectral Corruption ability, especially when combined with high attack and damage, make it an oversized threat for a level 7 monster. Replace it with: Spectral Corruption [two-actions] (curse, divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental) The specter makes a vile touch Strike. If it damages a living creature, the specter gains 5 temporary Hit Points and the target creature must attempt a DC 24 Will save to avoid becoming corrupted. Critical Success The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune to spectral corruption for 1 minute. Success The creature is stupefied 2 for 1 hour. Failure The creature succumbs to the corruption and becomes a spectral thrall temporarily. The creature is controlled by the specter, obeying the specter's telepathic or spoken orders, though a spectral thrall does not obey obviously self-destructive orders. This lasts until the end of the thrall\u2019s next turn, at which point it is no longer controlled but becomes stupefied 2 for 1 hour. Critical Failure As failure, but the duration is unlimited. The thrall can attempt a new Will save at the end of each of its turns; on a success, it is no longer controlled by the specter but becomes stupefied 2 for 1 hour. Change the vile touch Strike to \u201cvile touch +16 (finesse), Damage 2d8+8 negative.\u201d Note that this also cuts \"plus spectral corruption\" from the Strike, since it needs to use the Spectral Corruption activity to get the full effect. As a note for summoning specters, an upcoming erratum to the minion trait in the Core Rulebook will clarify that minions can't control other creatures, which means summoned specters can't control other creatures with Spectral Corruption. Page 249: \u2691 Both spiders' bite attacks should be \"fangs\" attacks. They are also missing their damage type, which should be piercing. Page 255: \u2691 Add the uncommon trait to the stygira. Page 260: \u2691 The giant tick has an enfeebled entry with no value. In tick fever, in the first stage, after enfeebled add \u201c1\u201d. Page 266: \u2691 The Two-Headed Troll's Reactive Chomp doesn't work quite right. Change it from a single action to a reaction. Replace its Requirements entry with Trigger On one head's initiative, the troll hits the same enemy with two consecutive claw Strikes in the same round - and change the effect to While the prey is distracted with unrelenting claw attacks, the head that's not taking its turn makes a jaws Strike against the enemy. Page 267: \u2691 Jotund troll\u2019s jaws Strike should have the Grab ability, so it can use its other abilities that happen when it Grabs creatures with its jaws. Page 281: \u2691 Add the incapacitation trait to the ostiarius's Focus Gaze ability. Page 286: \u2691 Add the uncommon trait to the violet venom item. Page 290-291: \u2691 Moon Frenzy should say \"jaws Strike (or a similar Strike)\" so that wereboar can use it. Additionally, the curse DCs are slightly off. Change wereboar's DC to 15 and weretiger's DC to 18. Page 300: \u2691 The yellow musk creeper's Spray Pollen is missing some of its information. First, it should have the incapacitation trait. Second, change the failure and critical failure entries to: Failure The creature is fascinated. For as long as it is fascinated, it must spend each of its actions to move closer to the yellow musk creeper as expediently as possible, while avoiding obvious dangers. If the creature is adjacent to the yellow musk creeper, it stays still and doesn't act. If anyone takes a hostile action against the creature or its allies, the effect ends. Otherwise, the creature can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the effects end. Critical Failure As failure, but the condition doesn't end automatically if anyone takes a hostile action against the creature or its allies. Page 301: \u2691 Add the uncommon trait to the yellow musk vial. Lost Omens Character Guide Errata \u2691 Page 25: \u2691 The ancient elf heritage is lacking guidance about an appropriate age for the heritage. After the heritage's first sentence, add \"A typical ancient elf is at least 100 years old, though you might be younger at the GM\u2019s discretion.\" As the heritage is based on an elf's biological lifespan, it is an example of the type of heritage that a half-elf can't take. Page 33: \u2691 Eclectic Obsession is missing an action/activity symbol. The feat requires one action. Page 45: \u2691 Cunning Climber is referencing a feat from the Pathfinder Playtest. Remove the final sentence from the Cunning Climber feat. Page 45: \u2691 The Incredible Luck feat is referencing the incorrect feat. In the feat's final sentence, change \"Helpful Halfling\" to \"Shared Luck.\" Page 50: \u2691 The Hobgoblin Weapon Familiarity feat was granting training in too many weapons for a single feat. Change the feat's first sentence to \"You are trained with composite longbows, composite shortbows, glaives, longbows, longswords, and shortbows.\" Page 50: \u2691 The sidebar is referring to a non-existent feat. In the final sentence of the sidebar, change \"Legion Recruit\" to \"Leech-Clipper.\" Page 51: \u2691 Add the auditory trait to the Pride in Arms feat, as it only works if your ally hears the shout.

After the heritage's final sentence, add \"You lose the plant trait and gain the fungus trait.\" Page 54: \u2691 The Seedpod feat was missing a range. Change the feat's second sentence to \"You gain a seedpod ranged unarmed attack with a range increment of 10 feet that deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage; these Strikes have the manipulate trait.\" Page 57: \u2691 Lizardfolk and catfolk are from nearby regions and we want to represent their relationship as neighbors, of a sort. Add Amurrun to the list in the lizardfolk base statistics sidebar of additional languages you can choose if you have a positive Intelligence modifier. Page 59: \u2691 Due to changes with how proficiency in unarmed strikes is determined, the Iruxi Unarmed Expertise feat is no longer needed. Replace it with the following feat. - Primal Rampage Feat 13 - Lizardfolk - You tap into the unstoppable, primeval strength of your ancient kin. You gain freedom of movement and stoneskin as 4th-level primal innate spells that you can cast once per day. As a 3-action activity, you can Cast a Spell twice to cast both of these innate spells, as long as they are both still available for the day. Page 74: \u2691 Add the mental trait to the Boaster's Challenge feat. Page 80: \u2691 Hellknight plate is missing an armor trait. In the armor's statistics, after the group classification, add \"Armor Traits Bulwark.\" Page 90: \u2691 Add the stance trait to the Impassable Wall Stance feat. Page 91: \u2691 The sun blade focus spell incorrectly lists a failure entry, rather than a success. Change the second degree of success line to \"Success The ray deals full damage.\" Page 95: \u2691 Invoke the Crimson Oath lacked information on a key spellcasting ability score. After the final sentence of the feat, add \"Your key spellcasting ability for these spells is Charisma.\" Page 104: \u2691 The language in the Halcyon Speaker Dedication was causing confusion as it referenced gaining access to spells. Change the second sentence of the feat to \"You gain two common Halcyon cantrips and two common 1st-level halcyon spells (see Halcyon Spells on page 100).\" Page 112: \u2691 The Pathfinder Agent Feats are incorrectly noted as uncommon. Only the dedication itself is uncommon, but once you have the dedication, the feats don't have any further restrictions. Remove the uncommon trait from the Forced Entry, Recognize Threat, Everyone Duck!, and Educated Assessment feats. Lost Omens Gods & Magic Errata \u2691 Page 15: \u2691 Asmodeus incorrectly lists two major curses. The second curse on the list (Asmodeus forces your compliance.) is a moderate curse. Page 48: \u2691 Urgathoa is missing the thematically appropriate plague domain in her entry. Add \"plague\" to her list of Alternate Domains. Page 107: \u2691 The agitate spell is meant to allow creatures to use their regular forms of movement, but not to Step. change the requirement to Stride to \"Stride, Fly, or Swim\" and add \"The GM might decide to add additional move actions to the list for creatures who possess only a more unusual form of movement.\" Page 107: \u2691 The animus mine spell should only the deal the mental damage on magical mental effects that send their magic into your mind, not if a creature tries to do something mundane like talk to you. Page 107: \u2691 The befuddle spell is missing a saving throw entry. Before the spell's duration, add \"Saving Throw Will.\" Page 107: \u2691 The chilling spray spell has the incorrect saving throw listed. Change the saving throw from \"Will\" to \"Reflex.\" Page 110: \u2691 The movement of the shifting sand spell should only occur once per round. Change the spell's third sentence to \"The first time each round you Sustain the Spell, you can move the churning area up to 10 feet in any direction.\" Page 111: \u2691 After you come back to your time beacon, the spell has had its effect and it's over. To make that clear, explicitly add \"After returning to the time beacon, the spell ends.\" Page 112: \u2691 The winter bolt focus spell has the incorrect targets listed. Change the spell's targets to \"1 creature.\" Page 115: \u2691 Add the attack trait to the charged javelin focus spell. Page 116: \u2691 The share burden focus spell is missing a targets entry. Add \"Targets you and the triggering ally.\" Page 118: \u2691 The stasis focus spell has the incorrect saving throw listed. Change the saving throw from \"Reflex\" to \"Will.\" Page 120: \u2691 The bladed scarf is intended to be a weapon that includes the finesse trait and deals a little less damage. Change bladed scarf damage from \"1d8\" to \"1d6\" and add the \"finesse\" trait to weapon's traits. Page 130: \u2691 Apsu is the god of all good dragons, not just lawful ones. Change Apsu's alignment entry to \"LG (LG, NG, CG).\" Page 132: \u2691 Change Sun Wukong's favored weapon from \"staff\" to \"bo staff.\" Page 132\u2013133: \u2691 Change Qi Zhong's anathema entry to \"Deal lethal damage to another living creature (unless as part of a necessary medical treatment).\" - This allows followers of Qi Zhong to attack non-living creatures such as constructs and undead without worry about Qi Zhong's anathema. Lost Omens Mwangi Expanse Errata \u2691 Page 103: \u2691 The Anadi Change Shape ability should allow a different set of actions in spider form to allow more manipulate actions than it currently does. Change it to say \"You change into your human or spider shape. Each shape has a specific, persistent appearance. In your human shape, you can\u2019t use unarmed attacks granted by your ancestry. You aren\u2019t flat footed when climbing in your spider shape. However, in your spider shape you can\u2019t use weapons, shields, or other held items of any sort, and you are limited in what actions you can take that have the manipulate trait. The only manipulate actions you can take are to Cast a Spell with somatic components, weave silk or webbing, or simple Interact actions such as opening an unlocked door. Your spider legs can't perform actions that require fingers or significant manual dexterity, including any action that would require a check to accomplish. The GM might determine other manipulate actions are appropriate for your spider legs\" Page 119: \u2691 The grippli ancestry ability modifiers are missing one of the ability scores that should have a +2 bonus. In total they should have +2 Dexterity, +2 Wisdom, -2 Strength, and one free ability boost. Lost Omens World Guide Errata \u2691 Updated Backgrounds \u2691 A number of backgrounds are granting training in the incorrect skills or inappropriate skill feats that didn't correspond with each other. Make the changes as noted below. Page(s) and location, followed by change \u2691 Page 22: \u2691 Grand Council Bureaucrat: Change \"Society\" to \"Diplomacy\" Page 46: \u2691 Nirmathi Guerilla: Change \"Survival\" to \"Stealth\" Page 17: \u2691 The archaic wayfinder requires investment, just like all other wayfinders. Add the invested trait to the archaic wayfinder. Page 23: \u2691 The Wayfinder Resonance Tinkerer feat is missing language about heightening the cantrip it grants you. After the feat's third sentence, add \"As normal, this cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.\" Page 28: \u2691 The aldori dueling sword mistakenly cost too much due to a lack of conversion to the silver piece standard for starting gear. Change the Aldori dueling sword's price to 2 gp. Page 71: \u2691 Crimson Shroud is a magical ability and should have a school and a tradition or the magical trait. Add the healing, magical, and necromancy traits to the Crimson Shroud feat. Page 95: \u2691 The Magic Warrior archetype should be uncommon, just like the other archetypes in the book. Add the uncommon trait to the Magic Warrior Dedication feat. Page 95: \u2691 The Nameless Anonymity feat is missing a tradition for its nondetection spell. After the final sentence, add \"The spell is of the same tradition as your focus spells.\" Page 117: \u2691 The exact nature of a megafauna animal companion is unclear. Any animal companion can be a megafauna animal companion, which changes how the animal companion can progress at a later time, allowing the animal companion to become a savage or indomitable animal companion instead. The GM has ultimate say on which animal companions can be megafauna animal companions, though most animal companions based on animals and beasts can be megafauna. - Before the first sentence of the Megafauna Minions sidebar, add \"When you pick your animal companion, you can choose to have it be a megafauna animal companion.\" Lost Omens Ancestry Guide Clarifications and Errata \u2691 What actions qualify for the requirements of the resonant weapon trait's Conduct Energy action? You can only use Conduct Energy with actions that have one of the required energy traits. Using an action other than a spell that causes damage with the listed trait does not necessarily qualify unless the action also has the trait. For example, if you used the ifrit's Scorching Disarm action, you could channel fire energy into your weapon via Conduct Energy, as Scorching Disarm itself has the fire trait. However, if you made a Strike with a flaming weapon, the Strike action does not have the fire trait, so you couldn't use Conduct Energy. Pages 6\u20137: \u2691 Fixed several uncomon mistakes. Page 11: \u2691 Add the \"healing\" trait to the Purge Sins feat. Page 38: \u2691 In the Winglets feat, on the second to last line, change \"10 feet higher\" to \"10 feet longer\". Page 42: \u2691 Change the last sentence of the fruit leshy to read, \"This effect has the healing, necromancy, positive, and primal traits.\" Page 51: \u2691 In the Special line for the Mask of Fear feat, change all instances of \"reaction\" to \"free action\". Page 79: \u2691 It was unclear which of the beastkin's shape was the natural shape for the purposes of Change Shape. Before the last sentence of the beastkin's heritage entry, add: \"A beastkin\u2019s hybrid form is their natural shape.\" Page 81: \u2691 The beastkin's Animal Shape feat was missing options for beastkin with insects as their inherent animal. Make the following changes to the Animal Shape feat: - Change the third sentence to read, \"When you gain this feat, choose either aerial form, animal form, dinosaur form, or insect form; after you choose a form, you can\u2019t change the form.\" - Change the fifth sentence to read, \"If your inherent animal isn\u2019t among the animals listed in the form, you default to the statistics and abilities of the bird battle form, cat battle form, deinonychus battle form, or ant battle form for aerial form, animal form, dinosaur form, and insect form, respectively (at the GM\u2019s discretion, you instead default to a different form that is closest to your inherent animal).\" Page 89: \u2691 The fleshwarp statistics did not fully line up with the flavor presented in the fleshwarp entry. Change the Size entry from \"Medium\" to \"Medium or Small\" to allow for Small fleshwarps, which might have originated from existing Small ancestries. Page 93: \u2691 Add the following prerequisites to the Eerie Compression feat: - Prerequisites: Medium size Page 123: \u2691 The dark fields kitsune heritage did not note how long the temporary Hit Points you gain from Invigorating Fear last. Add the following after the last sentence of Invigorating Fear: \"You lose any temporary Hit Points after 1 minute.\" Page 124: \u2691 Kitsune's foxfire should be magical. Change the fifth line of the Foxfire feat to read, \"Your foxfire is in the sling weapon group and has the magical trait.\" Page 124: \u2691 Change the last line of the Star Orb feat to read, \"It always has the innate surge master ability (Advanced Player\u2019s Guide 147), which counts against your limit for familiar and master abilities. \" Page 137: \u2691 In the Wing Step feat, change \"You Step twice\" to \"You Step 5 feet twice.\" Page 138: \u2691 Rungus are real-world weapons and their original description ignored their cultural significance. We updated the description to better reflect the weapon's real-world origins and give it a better sense of place in the setting. Change the second sentence of the rungu's description to \"Rungus were invented by Zenj humans of the Mwangi Expanse and are most common among their tribes, though gripplis have also adopted rungus for hunting creatures that hide high in treetops.\" Page 138: \u2691 It was unclear if the taw launcher was a crossbow or not and thus function with crossbow-related abilities and effects. The taw launcher is a crossbow. In the first sentence of the taw launcher description, change the word \"resembles\" to \"is\". Page 139: \u2691 Change the wish knife's versatile P trait to versatile S. Page 139: \u2691 Add the conrasu trait to the taw launcher entry in Table 1\u20132: Ranged Weapons. Paizo.com uses cookies.

Fortunately, your career is young, and course-correction is fairly straightforward. Between adventures, you can check the box that precedes this boon to completely rebuild your character so long as they have 48 or fewer XP (the Career Change boon allows you to rebuild a character of any level). Remove everything your character has purchased with gp, as well as their class, feats, skill proficiencies, and related features. You may not alter the character's ancestry, heritage or background, but you may change the ability score boosts you selected at character creation. Your character\u2019s wealth is set to 85% of the total gold you\u2019ve earned\u2014this reduction represents a small amount lost from consumable use as well as items sold back for a particularly favorable rate. This rebuilding process does not change the amount of Fame, Reputation, or gp the character has earned, nor does it change the resources your character has expended on services such as spellcasting. You can also refund any faction boons for the Fame price at which you purchased them, though you cannot sell back Limited-Use boons that you have expended or Faction Champion boons that you have used to earn Reputation for a faction. All changes to the character must be applied by the time the character next plays an adventure; once the adventure begins, no further changes can be made with this boon. Career Change \u2691 [ ] Career Change (Limited-Use, Service): Your existing abilities have helped you achieve success in the field, but you\u2019re overdue for a drastic change if you\u2019re to continue succeeding in the adventures to come. Between adventures, you can check the box that precedes this boon to completely rebuild your character. Remove everything your character has purchased with gp, as well as their class, feats, skill proficiencies, and related features. You may not alter the character's ancestry, heritage or background, but you may change the ability score boosts you selected at character creation. Your character\u2019s wealth is set to 85% of the total gold you\u2019ve earned\u2014this reduction represents a small amount lost from consumable use as well as items sold back for a particularly favorable rate.

Treasure Bundle Insurance \u2691 [ ] [ ] [ ] Even when your careful searching doesn\u2019t uncover all of a site\u2019s valuables, you\u2019re able to appraise, repair, and certify what you did recover to maximize their value. You can check a box that precedes this boon at the end of a scenario when you and your allies recovered 9 or fewer of the adventure\u2019s Treasure Bundles. Increase the effective number of Treasure Bundles recovered by 1 for the purpose of calculating the group\u2019s gold piece rewards. The total number of additional Treasure Bundles provided by this boon cannot exceed the adventure's maximum (10, for a typical scenario). Special : Multiple copies of this boon can be used during the same adventure, but only to recover up to a total of three lost Treasure Bundles.

Bequeathal boons \u2691 Update January 2022 : Previously, this boon had a stipulation that the character receiving the option must wait until they reached the level of the original chronicle sheet to use the option. This text was removed as it was redundant. Pathfinders often find strange treasures for which they might not have any use. In keeping with the Society's ethos of cooperation, generous Pathfinders spend some of their own time and resources tracking down other agents who could benefit more from these rewards. When you acquire this boon, select one [Uncommon/Rare/Unique] character option to which you\u2019ve gained access through an adventure\u2019s Chronicle Sheet or via a no-cost boon from the online boon store (e.g., a listed magic item or a boon that allows you to acquire a special animal companion). Choose another of your characters. That character gains access to that special option instead. The receiving PC must also meet any prerequisites for the boon (e.g. they must be Liked by a particular faction to access that faction\u2019s unique gear from Lost Omens Pathfinder Society Guide). On the Chronicle Sheet or Boon, write \u201cBequeathed\u201d and the recipient character\u2019s number next to the option. You no longer have access to that option (and must retrain the character option or sell an item back for full cost if you acquired the option and would no longer qualify for it). Option Chosen: _ _ _ _ _ ____ Bequeathed To: -20 _ ___ Does the Bequeathal boon allow you to transfer Chronicle Boons that have no rarity? \u2691 No, it does not. The boon allows you to transfer access to character options.

You can bring your character to a public game anywhere in the world. Why Organized Play? \u2691 Organized Play is a great way for busy adults to get gaming sessions in; often, we cannot find time to commit to a weekly group with friends. Organized Play lets you bring your character to thousands of public events anywhere in the world. Benefits Consistency : Adventures are designed and run and with consistency in mind Convenience : Busy players can pick up and play whenever their schedule permits, anywhere in the world Variety : Players can build a large number of characters Community standards : Organized play adheres to community standards designed to create mutually respectful play experiences Social : Players make new friends by sharing a hobby Drawbacks More paperwork : As a global campaign, players need good accounting methods and are tracked and sometimes audited The \"railroad\" : Adventures are pre-written to fit into a time slot, so players don't have time for lengthy story diversions Not a customized campaign : The GM cannot facilitate long-term character arcs Older website : The Paizo website is required to use, but can be tricky to navigate For many players, Organized play games scratch a different itch than a home campaign with friends, and they play both. Getting Started \u2691 This is an independent guide and not affiliated with Paizo. To get started, check out the official Organized Play Foundation website: New Player Welcome Getting Started in Pathfinder Society Getting Started in Starfinder Society Important Links \u2691 New and returning players may need quick access to important game information: Register Pathfinder 2e FaQ & Errata Starfinder FaQ & Errata 2e Character Options Starfinder Character Options 2e Boon Text (under the heading Achievement Points and Boons Join Organized Play \u2691 Create an account \u2691 All Organized Play members must have a Paizo account. Here's how to set that up: Navigate to the sign in page Fill out your date of birth Click Continue Fill out the fields, including an active email address you can check (required) Click Create New Account Log into your email Click the link to verify your new account Enter a public username for your account Enter a password and re-rype it Select your preferences regarding private messages and transactional emails Agree to the privacy policy by making sure the box is checked Click Confirm Join Organized Play \u2691 There are two paths to joining organized play: Getting a number by attending a game or convention, or registering one for yourself. A New Player Organized Play Card given to a player; note the Organized Play ID and Confirmation Code. To activate your ID, or get a new one, follow these steps: Sign in to the Paizo site Go to your Account by clicking My Account in the site navigation Sign in again if asked to Click on Join Organized play Account Settings with the `Join Organized Play` button circled. Next, you are taken to a window with two options. The leftmost option is for the users who received an Organized Play number already (such as at a convention). If you received such a card, fill out this form. The rightmost option is for those who do not have a registration number. If you have an Organized Play number and confirmation code, you need to use the leftmost button. If you don't have one, use the rightmost button. If you select the left option, the organized play ID will become associated with your account. If you select the rightmost option, your character will be assigned the next available ID. Components of your ID \u2691 Your ID consists of two parts: your Organized Play Number, and a number determined by the system. Starfinder characters start with -701 and count up from there; Pathfinder 2e characters start with -2001 and count up from there. So, your first registered character's ID should look something like 123456-2001 . Never Lose your ID Never lose your org play ID. It is difficult (if not impossible) to recover. If you receive a card at a convention, it is a good idea to take a picture of it as a backup. Creating a Character \u2691 Log in at https://paizo.com/organizedPlay/myAccount (or create an account) Click on Create a Character Scroll to the bottom of the page and click Register a New [Game System] Character Enter the character's name. You may need to add a number after it so it's unique \u2014 that's ok, this is just part of the character's unique record for accounting purposes on the Paizo website, it doesn't have to be the character's official name in games Select a faction (optional) Ignore the rest, no one uses it Click Submit Changes Paperwork \u2691 The core tracking mechanisms of Organized play are twofold: games reported to the Paizo website by the person who organized the event, and the chronicles and boons you receive as a player. What are Chronicles & Boons? \u2691 A Chronicle is a catch-all term for an official record in organized Play. It a receipt that tracks your earned XP, gold, and even access to certain special character options. A Boon is a receipt that grants a reward of some kind to the player or PC. Chronicle vs Boon : You may hear the terms used interchangeably. Generally, this isn't a big deal. You can see how the post adventure chronicle is laid out at the official Guide . No matter how you store your paperwork, you should keep good records in a format you can show to other players. Here is an example of a character's digital records. Note that the character has several kinds of boons, and uses a spreadsheet to track his inventory. The player could bring this character to any game, and show this paperwork to a GM who wished to audit the character.

General \u2691 Bonus Reputation \u2691 How much bonus Reputation should I earn for completing a faction mission? \u2691 Scenarios with Faction tags award bonus reputation with that faction for completing certain objectives. These should award 2 Reputation. Some early scenarios only awarded 1 Reputation under the Faction Notes at the end of the adventure; this is incorrect, and it should be 2. Unlocking Access \u2691 What does unlocking access to items mean? \u2691 When you have access to an uncommon or rare item, you can purchase it at its listed price. You can also purchase the formula for these items you have access to from the Pathfinder Society at the same price as a common formula of the same level. Only the PC with the relevant boon attached gains access to this item. Formulas for items which limit how many a character may obtain (e.g. the dwarven daisy fireworks from Quest 5) are not available. Upgrading Uncommon/Rare Items \u2691 Can I get an upgraded version of an Uncommon or Rare item if I have access to a basic version? \u2691 Yes, in most cases. If you are granted access to an item and its upgraded versions have the same rarity, you have access to those as well. For example, if you had access to the oil of object animation, this would also grant access to the greater oil of object animation, but the Common disrupting rune does not grant access to the Uncommon greater disrupting rune. This does not apply if the higher-level item is Limited or Restricted (unless the source of access says otherwise), or if the item is not a strict upgrade (e.g. access to one Uncommon aeon stone does not grant access to all higher-level aeon stones). Unlocking Spell Access \u2691 What does unlocking access to spells mean? \u2691 Having access to an uncommon or rarer spell means that your character(s) can learn the spell in the same way they learn other spells, provided they meet all prerequisites. A character must have access to the spell to learn it from another character that knows it. Only the PC with the relevant boon attached gains access to this spell. Ammunition Access \u2691 How do I get access to ammunition for a weapon? \u2691 Characters with access to a weapon also automatically are granted access to basic ammunition for that weapon, if necessary (e.g. characters with access to a flintlock pistol also have access to firearm ammunition). Characters do not automatically have access to unusual types of ammunition for the same weapon, though other factors (Home Region, class, boons, etc) may grant such access. Adjusting Aid DCs \u2691 Do table GMs have the ability to adjust the DC of a check to Aid, or is it set to the typical DC of 20, listed in the Core Rulebook ? \u2691 Use DC 20 unless otherwise stated in the adventure. For particularly effective means of Aiding, the GM should consider giving the PCs a circumstance bonus on the check to Aid. Circumstance Bonuses/Penalties \u2691 Can GMs apply circumstance bonuses and penalties based upon the PCs' actions (for example, to reward creative solutions, or to reflect a particularly ineffective tactic)? \u2691 Yes, GMs can apply circumstance bonuses or penalties based on the PCs' actions. For guidance in how and when to apply these, see \"Ad Hoc Bonuses and Penalties\" on page 12 of the Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide. Hero Points for Downtime \u2691 Can I use a Hero Point on my Day Job or Crafting roll at the end of a scenario? \u2691 Hero Points cannot be used on Downtime checks. Hirelings for Gold \u2691 Are the hirelings as listed in the Core Rulebook available for hire? \u2691 Pathfinder Society characters may not pay for hirelings as listed in the Core Rulebook. More capable hirelings are available via the Achievement Points system. Bonus Feats at 5th Level \u2691 What happens if a character reaches 5th level and cannot take any of the bonus feats available with Pathfinder Training? What if a character has already taken all the feats available at that level? \u2691 If a character does not meet the prerequisites for any bonus Pathfinder Training feat, they can hold off on making a selection until they do meet the prerequisites for at least one feat. Since all classes grant skill increases at 5th level, characters who would not otherwise meet the prerequisites might consider using that skill increase to qualify. Some of the feats available at 5th level are feats that can be taken more than once (e.g. Multilingual and Assurance), so most characters should have a feat option available. However, if a character truly has exhausted all options, they may instead take a 1st level skill feat for which they qualify. Retraining & New Options \u2691 When retraining or rebuilding, can a character select options that they did not have access to initially, such as those earned from a boon or options from a newly-released book? \u2691 Yes. As long as the final character is a valid character that could have been built from 1st level with access to all options, newly-accessible options may be chosen. It is not necessary to track the exact time when a character gained access to a particular option. Willingly Failing Saves \u2691 Can I willingly fail a save if my ally is attempting to use an item or ability to benefit me? \u2691 Pathfinder Society uses the optional rules published with the liminal on page 143 of Bestiary 3 for this situation, which are reproduced here: There aren\u2019t default rules for a creature choosing to be hit[...], but you can allow an ally to improve their outcome by one degree of success against a willing target or allow the target to worsen the result of their saving throw by one step. Massive Damage \u2691 Do massive damage rules apply in Organized Play? \u2691 If a character has fewer than 20 Hit Points, treat their Hit Points as 20 when determining if their character dies from massive damage. Similar Lores \u2691 How should GMs handle Lores with similar names, such as Pathfinder Lore and Pathfinder Society Lore? \u2691 If a scenario calls for a specific Lore and a player has an extremely similar Lore (such as Pathfinder Lore in place of Pathfinder Society Lore), the GM should permit the use of that Lore. If a Lore is adjacent (e.g. Academia Lore in place of Library Lore), the GM can permit its use if they feel the two overlap enough. Ultimately, the GM is empowered to use their best judgment in such situations. Animal Companion Death \u2691 What happens if my animal companion or minion dies in combat? \u2691 Non-summoned minions do not immediately die when they reach 0 HP. Instead, they begin dying much like player characters and must make Recovery Checks at the beginning of their controller's turns. Their controller's initiative count does not change when this happens, and if they reach Dying 4, they die as usual. Undead PCs \u2691 What are the rules for undead PCs in the Pathfinder Society campaign? \u2691 Undead PCs, such as skeletons, follow the following rules, in addition to all rules from their source material. Please note that these are campaign-specific clarifications and should not be treated as official errata or design clarifications. Skeletons and other undead do not use the undead creature traits, instead using the Basic Undead Benefits (Book of the Dead 44). Skeletons and other undead do not need to breathe unless otherwise stated. Undead PCs cannot be targeted by PC-casted resurrect rituals or similar. We have updated the Second Chance boon to indicate that it can also be used to bring these PCs back to life in their undead state if desired. As per an update to the Guide to Organized Play , undead PCs can obtain an [i]oil of unlife[/i] anytime a Pathfinder Society-aligned NPC would give them an equivalent potion of healing. The Character Options have also been updated to allow all PCs to purchase [i]oils of unlife[/i] without owning the Advanced Player's Guide. Character Creation \u2691 Language Access \u2691 What languages do characters from Absalom have access to? \u2691 Characters from Absalom have access to Erutaki, Hallit, Kelish, Mwangi, Osiriani, Shoanti, Skald, Tien, Varki, Varisian, and Vudrani. Home Regions \u2691 Are only the regions listed in the Core Rulebook available to choose as a character's Home Region? \u2691 The regions listed in the CRB are the ones that have been fully defined. Future books may define additional regions. In the meantime, for other areas of the world, you can select a single nation to gain access to options tied to that nation. Uncommon Languages \u2691 Are the languages on Tables 2-1 and 2-2 of the Core Rulebook the only languages that can be added with feats or ability increases, or can Common and Uncommon languages from other sources also be added? \u2691 The Character Options entry for many books says, \"All options are of standard availability unless specifically noted otherwise.\" Languages are a type of option that characters can select, so they are included in this statement. Unconventinoal Weaponry & Culture \u2691 What is considered a \"culture\" for the purposes of Unconventional Weaponry? \u2691 For Unconventional Weaponry, look for access conditions based upon nationality, ethnic group, or other groups of similar broad significance. It does not cover organizations that PCs might choose to join (such as the Firebrands, Hellknights, Knights of Lastwall, or Magaambya). Regional Uncommon Weapons \u2691 Some uncommon weapons are associated with particular regions, but do not have listed access conditions. Which regions can my character be from to gain access to these weapons? \u2691 For the purposes of Pathfinder Society play, choosing the following regions as a Home Region (or with the World Traveler boon) grants access to the following items: Region Items Granted Vudra katar, temple sword, urumi Jinin, Minkai, Shokuro kama, katana, naginata, nunchaku, sai, shuriken, tekko-kagi, wakizashi Golden Road kukri, khopesh Impossible Lands katar, kukri, temple sword, urumi Mwangi Expanse mambele Saga Lands bladed scarf [NEW] High Seas boarding axe Upgrading Items \u2691 Can I upgrade permanent items? \u2691 Yes, players may upgrade permanent magical items or items made from special materials using the Crafting rules on page 535 of the Core Rulebook . Players may not upgrade adventuring gear or consumable items in this manner. Paying off Cost Differences \u2691 Can I pay the cost difference to upgrade a permanent item instead of using Craft to do it myself? \u2691 Yes. The Pathfinder Society has numerous crafters that assist their fellow agents. Use the rules for upgrading magic items on page 535 of the Core Rulebook . Tiny PCs \u2691 What are the rules for Tiny PCs? \u2691 Tiny PCs use all rules for Riding PCs and Tiny PCs as detailed on page 66 of Lost Omens Ancestry Guide. In addition, Tiny PCs use the following clarifications for Pathfinder Society play: Your character has contacts and connections within the Pathfinder Society that allow them to procure appropriately-sized gear. Whenever gear is available for purchase, your character can secure a version of this gear that is appropriate for their size. Specific items found in the course of the adventure are typically sized for Medium creatures. Use the standard rules for Medium creatures using Large equipment to adjudicate the effects of using equipment that is too large for them (for example, your Tiny PC can wield a Small or Medium weapon, though it\u2019s unwieldy, granting them the clumsy 1 condition). When your Tiny PC invests a magic item, the item automatically shrinks to an appropriate size and Bulk. Learning Non-Core Divine/Primal Spells \u2691 How can clerics, druids and wizards learn spells from sources outside of the Core Rulebook? \u2691 For the purposes of Pathfinder Society play, modify the Divine or Primal Spellcasting entries of these classes (or the Spellbook entry, for the Wizard) to remove the phrase \u201cin this book\u201d or \"from this book.\" These characters have access to all common spells on their respective spell lists as outlined on the Character Options page. The Resource Ownership rules still apply for these characters as normal. Characters who previously spent gold to Learn a Spell that they now have access to natively are refunded the gold spent. Steed Ally / Cavaliers & Mount \u2691 Can champions with a Steed Ally or cavaliers choose an animal companion without the mount special ability? \u2691 By default, champions and cavaliers do not have access to animal companions without the mount special ability. However, boons may grant access to other options in the future. Restoring Unique Companions \u2691 How can I restore my unique animal companion if they die? \u2691 A unique animal companion cannot be restored by spending a week of Downtime as other animal companions can. Animal companions and other minions can always be restored to life by spells such as raise dead or the Second Chance Achievement Point boon. Achievement Points \u2691 *Docs Author Note: I put the boons on their own page . Here are the general items from the FaQ: Boon Purchased for Wrong PC \u2691 What do I do if a boon was purchased for the wrong character? \u2691 Email orgplayreportingerrors@paizo.com with your Organized Play ID, the incorrect boon, and your desired resolution (either a refund of the points or transfer to a different character). Changing Ancestry /Background with Rebuilds \u2691 Can I change my ancestry and background with one of the rebuild boons? \u2691 Career Change and Evolving Destiny do not allow this. Changing Abilitie with Rebuilds \u2691 Can ability boosts and flaws be changed with one of the rebuilding boons? \u2691 Career Change and Evolving Destiny do permit characters to change the ability score boosts and flaws selected at character creation. They still do not permit alteration of the selected ancestry, heritage or background. As of October 8, 2021, the boons\u2019 text has been updated to reflect this clarification. Helping Purchase Second Chance \u2691 Can party members help purchase the Second Chance boon? \u2691 Party members may contribute gold to any costs incurred as part of the resurrection ritual. They may also sell the deceased characters\u2019 items to help contribute to the cost if the player consents. Bequethal \u2691 Does the Bequeathal boon allow you to transfer Chronicle Boons that have no rarity? \u2691 Not, it does not. The boon allows you to transfer access to character options. The reference to Chronicle Sheets and rewards from the boon store exists to tell you which places that you could gain access are eligible for transfer via Bequeathal.","title":"PFS FaQ"},{"location":"organized-play/pfs-faq/#pfs-faq","text":"For full boon text, see the Boons page.","title":"PFS FaQ"},{"location":"organized-play/pfs-faq/#general","text":"","title":"General"},{"location":"organized-play/pfs-faq/#bonus-reputation","text":"","title":"Bonus Reputation"},{"location":"organized-play/pfs-faq/#unlocking-access","text":"","title":"Unlocking Access"},{"location":"organized-play/pfs-faq/#upgrading-uncommonrare-items","text":"","title":"Upgrading Uncommon/Rare Items"},{"location":"organized-play/pfs-faq/#unlocking-spell-access","text":"","title":"Unlocking Spell Access"},{"location":"organized-play/pfs-faq/#ammunition-access","text":"","title":"Ammunition Access"},{"location":"organized-play/pfs-faq/#adjusting-aid-dcs","text":"","title":"Adjusting Aid DCs"},{"location":"organized-play/pfs-faq/#circumstance-bonusespenalties","text":"","title":"Circumstance Bonuses/Penalties"},{"location":"organized-play/pfs-faq/#hero-points-for-downtime","text":"","title":"Hero Points for Downtime"},{"location":"organized-play/pfs-faq/#hirelings-for-gold","text":"","title":"Hirelings for Gold"},{"location":"organized-play/pfs-faq/#bonus-feats-at-5th-level","text":"","title":"Bonus Feats at 5th Level"},{"location":"organized-play/pfs-faq/#retraining-new-options","text":"","title":"Retraining &amp; New Options"},{"location":"organized-play/pfs-faq/#willingly-failing-saves","text":"","title":"Willingly Failing Saves"},{"location":"organized-play/pfs-faq/#massive-damage","text":"","title":"Massive Damage"},{"location":"organized-play/pfs-faq/#similar-lores","text":"","title":"Similar Lores"},{"location":"organized-play/pfs-faq/#animal-companion-death","text":"","title":"Animal Companion Death"},{"location":"organized-play/pfs-faq/#undead-pcs","text":"","title":"Undead PCs"},{"location":"organized-play/pfs-faq/#character-creation","text":"","title":"Character Creation"},{"location":"organized-play/pfs-faq/#language-access","text":"","title":"Language Access"},{"location":"organized-play/pfs-faq/#home-regions","text":"","title":"Home Regions"},{"location":"organized-play/pfs-faq/#uncommon-languages","text":"","title":"Uncommon Languages"},{"location":"organized-play/pfs-faq/#unconventinoal-weaponry-culture","text":"","title":"Unconventinoal Weaponry &amp; Culture"},{"location":"organized-play/pfs-faq/#regional-uncommon-weapons","text":"","title":"Regional Uncommon Weapons"},{"location":"organized-play/pfs-faq/#upgrading-items","text":"","title":"Upgrading Items"},{"location":"organized-play/pfs-faq/#paying-off-cost-differences","text":"","title":"Paying off Cost Differences"},{"location":"organized-play/pfs-faq/#tiny-pcs","text":"","title":"Tiny PCs"},{"location":"organized-play/pfs-faq/#learning-non-core-divineprimal-spells","text":"","title":"Learning Non-Core Divine/Primal Spells"},{"location":"organized-play/pfs-faq/#steed-ally-cavaliers-mount","text":"","title":"Steed Ally / Cavaliers &amp; Mount"},{"location":"organized-play/pfs-faq/#restoring-unique-companions","text":"","title":"Restoring Unique Companions"},{"location":"organized-play/pfs-faq/#achievement-points","text":"*Docs Author Note: I put the boons on their own page .

Items : All characters have access to: the scholarly journal, scholarly journal compendium, survey map, and survey map atlas (page 291). All characters have access to the wayfinder (page 617). Spells : All characters have access to raise dead (page 362). Rituals : All characters have access to atone (page 409) and resurrect (page 415).

Rulings and Clarifications \u2691 Please follow these rulings and clarifications specific to Pathfinder Society play wherever they conflict with the language printed in the original source. The level 1 version of summon plant or fungus (page 376) can be used to summon a leaf leshy (Pathfinder Bestiary page 218) that has the weak adjustment (Pathfinder Bestiary page 6). This is an exception to the rule that summon spells do not normally allow you to adjust the level of the summoned monsters by applying adjustments or templates to them. The Experienced Smuggler skill feat (page 261) allows you to Earn Income using Underworld Lore with tasks of your level \u20131, instead of the normal level \u20132. Add the following regional languages to the options listed on page 432. As with other regional languages, a character hailing from the region listed below automatically has access to these languages. Erutaki: Saga Lands Varki: Saga Lands Some creatures have abilities that only end or trigger when they are killed. In Organized Play, abilities that only end when a creature is killed end when a summoned version of the creature is banished. Abilities that trigger when a creature is killed do not trigger when banishing a summoned creature, including when a creature is reduced to 0 Hit Points and banished per the Summoned trait. Gamemastery guide \u2691 he Gamemastery Guide primarily contains tools for GMs, new subsystems, and rules variants rather than direct player options, all content from this book is of limited availability. However, Organized Play will be drawing from the rules options in this book in creating future adventures, boons, and other content. Advanced Players Guide \u2691 Rarity and Access Adjustments \u2691 Ancestries : Due to years of successful Pathfinder Society activities, all characters have access to the kobold ancestry (page 12). Archetypes : All characters have access to the vigilante archetype (page 196). Option Availability \u2691 Standard \u2691 All options are of standard availability unless specifically noted otherwise. Ancestries : All ancestry and versatile heritage options, other than kobolds, are of standard availability. As the catfolk, orc, ratfolk, and tengu ancestries and the aasimar, changeling, dhampir, duskwalker, and tiefling versatile heritages are uncommon, this means they are limited to boon access through Chronicle Sheets or the Achievement Point system. Orc feats can continue to be taken by half-orc characters who meet the prerequisites or access requirements, as normal.

The snares created with the Snare Genius kobold ancestry feat (page 15) are temporary items and become unusable after 24 hours or during your next daily preparations, whichever comes first. The Tusks orc ancestry feat (page 18) requires the character to file down their tusks or perform a similar action to retrain; this is part of the normal retraining process and does not take any additional time. The temporary Hit Points granted by the Spell Devourer orc ancestry feat (page 19) are applied as soon as the character succeeds at their saving throw; for an effect that causes Hit Point damage on a successful save, such as a fireball, this means that the character gains the temporary Hit Points before taking damage. Unless specifically noted otherwise, most wands and scrolls are less than 1 foot long and can fit into a ratfolk\u2019s Cheek Pouches (page 22). Per design team clarification, the Homeward Bound gnome feat (page 44) should be of uncommon rarity. Per design team clarification, the Speed penalty inflicted by the Kneecap feat (page 45) has a duration of 1 round. GMs should provide a character with the That\u2019s Odd investigator feat (page 60) a hint whenever the character enters a room with hidden aspects, specifically with regard to hidden passageways (such as scuff marks near a bookcase that\u2019s actually a swinging door), creatures or hazards (such as drippage on the floor from an unseen fungus growing on the rafters), or valuables (such as bunched carpet over a secret compartment in the floor that contains a bag of coins). The GM does not need to provide clues for rooms that have no significant secret or hidden features. These clues should indicate only that the character should investigate a given section of the room, not let them automatically uncover the hidden element or provide any additional information beyond signaling its presence. GMs should let a character with the Sense the Unseen investigator feat (page 64) know when the trigger for the ability has been met so they can use the feat if they so choose. Given the slightly relaxed rules around edicts and anathema in Society play, a barbarian with the superstition instinct (page 108) can benefit from spells and magic items if they are an unavoidable part of a Society adventure, such as if a scenario assumes the PCs are transported to their mission location via a teleport spell, or if an adventure requires that all PCs participate in a magical ritual. Per design team clarification, when a barbarian uses the Sunder Spell feat (page 111) against a spell like wall of fire that does not have a listed AC, the Strike hits automatically\u2014the barbarian simply rolls the counteract check. A cavalier (page 184) can pledge to a legal deity, religion, or pantheon, an organization they have access to, or the Pathfinder Society. The edicts and anathema of the Pathfinder Society are as follows: Edicts: Explore important sites, report and record your discoveries, and cooperate with fellow Pathfinders Anathema: Fail to explore, report and cooperate; defy the will of a venture-captain or the Decemvirate A vigilante\u2019s Safe House (page 196), can be located in any city or near any lodge they have received a Pathfinder briefing. A vigilante can use their downtime to relocate their safe house. A vigilante can use their safe house only if it is in the town or location where their current adventure is taking place. The DCs for the Armor Assist feat (page 203) are not subject to GM adjudication. Rather, simply use the default DCs listed in the feat: 15 for common armor, 20 for uncommon armor, and 25 for rare armor. For the purposes of Society play, the Targets entry for the claim undead (page 230) oracle revelation spell is \u201c1 mindless undead creature\u201d, not \u201c1 undead creature.\u201d The intent of this change is to reduce the prevalence of domination magic on sapient creatures in Society play. Strikes made by a malicious shadow (page 238) use the spellcaster\u2019s spell attack roll.

Any associated character options should be considered Limited. Restricted Eidolons Demon eidolons (page 62) and any evil eidolons Rulings and Clarifications \u2691 Please follow these rulings and clarifications specific to Pathfinder Society play wherever they conflict with the language printed in the original source. Backgrounds \u2691 The lore chosen from the Eidolon Contact background can only be associated with a specific creature or category of creatures, not a broad creature type. Eidolons \u2691 Eidolons are not PCs, so they do not count as PCs for effects that scale based on the number of PCs or players. Eidolons and summoners share a pool of actions. As a result, for Victory Point/success counting systems that allow each PC a limited number of chances to roll, either the summoner or the eidolon can attempt each check. The summoner's player chooses for each attempt which of the two rolls. Any direct consequences of failure apply to whichever creature rolled the check. This rule does not mean that in general only one of the summoner or eidolon need to roll to deal with adverse situations. If everyone in a room needs to attempt a saving throw against a hazard, both the eidolon and the summoner need to attempt that saving throw. If every PC needs to overcome a particular obstacle in order to continue (such as crossing a chasm), the eidolon and summoner both need to get past the obstacle. Classes \u2691 A magus with the Laughing Shadow hybrid study replaces shift blame with time jump as their 11th level Studious Spell. Class Feats \u2691 Using the Phase Out summoner ability (page 70) means that your eidolon cannot make any Strikes, nor can it take any actions requiring a physical form. Items \u2691 Fulus do not expire after one year. Players cannot create their own fulus or personal staves. A basic retrieval prism must be attuned to a PC to function. The holy water generated by an anointed waterskin does not persist beyond the end of a session and has an effective sale price of 0 gp. Spells \u2691 The summon lesser servitor spell cannot be used to summon imps. Guns & Gears \u2691 Rarity and Access Adjustments \u2691 All Pathfinder Society agents have access to the Gunslinger and Inventor classes and archetypes. Inventors (and characters with the Inventor archetype) gain access to uncommon clockwork items and gadgets from Chapters 1 and 2 of this book, unless the item specifically states otherwise. Gunslingers (and characters with the Gunslinger archetype) gain access to all uncommon weapons, ammunition, and related items from Chapter 4 of this book, with the exception of Beast Guns and any limited or restricted items below, unless the item indicates otherwise. As stated on page 148 of Guns & Gears, feats that grant access to weapons with ancestry traits (such as Dwarven Weapon Familiarity), do not grant access to firearms with the listed trait unless the character separately has access to firearms. The reverse is also true, that general access to firearms does not grant access to ancestry-specific weapons. If you have access to firearms, you can gain access to firearms with an ancestry trait (dwarf, elf, goblin, etc.) by selecting an ancestry feat or other option that specifically grants it (for example, to gain access to a clan pistol, take the Clan Pistol feat or Dwarven Weapon Familiarity feat). Characters with a Home Region of Absalom, New Thassilon, or Arcadia have access to uncommon clockwork items from Chapters 1 and 2, as inventors. Characters with a Home Region of Alkenstar, Dongun Hold, or the Shackles have access to all black powder guns, ammunition and related accessories; and all archetypes from Chapter 3 with the exception of beast gunner, fireworks technician, and spellshot. Characters from Alkenstar or Dongun Hold also have access to uncommon clockwork items from Chapters 1 and 2, as inventors. Characters with a Home Region of Tian Xia or Vudra have access to hand cannons and fire lances, associated ammunition and accessories; and the fireworks technician archetype. Characters with a Home Region of Arcadia have access to air guns, beast guns, non-black powder ammunition and accessories; and all archetypes from Chapter 3 with the exception of fireworks technician and demolitionist. Players who own a copy of the Goblin Fireworks Fight board game gain access to the fireworks technician archetype for all their characters. A copy of the game\u2019s instruction booklet is sufficient to prove ownership. Characters with access to a firearm also automatically are granted access to the firearm cleaning kit and basic ammunition for that weapon, if necessary (e.g. characters with access to a flintlock pistol also have access to firearm ammunition). Option Availability \u2691 Standard \u2691 All options are of standard availability unless specifically noted otherwise.

Players are not subject to the rules on page 203 for mechanical errors. Restricted \u2691 Archetypes Demolitionist (page 133) Feats Axial Recall (Automaton; page 43) Items All siege weapons and vehicles are restricted, due to their unsuitability for the constraints of Organized Play. Rulings and Clarifications \u2691 Please follow these rulings and clarifications specific to Pathfinder Society play wherever they conflict with the language printed in the original source. For the automaton\u2019s Rain of Bolts feat, the DC is the higher of your class DC or spell DC. For the purpose of gunslinger feats and abilities, if the ability states that you fire your weapon, you fire your weapon; if it does not state as such, you do not have to fire your weapon. Notably, Fake Out does not require you to actually fire your weapon. For the gunslinger\u2019s Alchemical Shot feat and any similar abilities that change a weapon\u2019s damage type, only the primary damage\u2019s type is affected; any secondary effects (such as precision damage or damage applied from a rune) are not affected. For the gunslinger\u2019s Dance of Fire feat, the first set of three actions must be resolved before subsequent sets of actions can be taken. Characters with the Sniping Duo archetype may choose their sniping partner at the beginning of the scenario without spending Downtime to retrain the option. The clan pistol\u2019s ammunition costs 1 sp for 10 rounds. The glitterdust spell cast by the fairy bullet has a DC of 23 (as is standard for a 7th-level item). Weapons that install an air cartridge firing system and that have the kickback trait retain the trait and the associated drawbacks.

The rules for Starting Out as Undead and Becoming Undead (page 45) are not used in Organized Play. Dark Archive \u2691 A reminder that in keeping with the \u201cExplore, Report, Cooperate\u201d motto of the Pathfinder Society, engaging in non-consensual character-versus-character conflict is prohibited. While accidental friendly fire happens due to missed attack rolls or other factors, players must obtain the consent of other players before taking an action that would include another PC in a damaging effect or other or harmful effect (such as effects that impose negative conditions). Some examples include casting a harmful spell on another PC or an area that includes them, throwing a splash weapon that would deal splash damage to another PC, or moving closer to another PC while surrounded by a harmful emanation in a way that exposes them to its effects. This rule does not apply in situations where a character is not acting of their own free will, such as if they\u2019re being mind-controlled by an NPC and forced to attack a fellow Pathfinder.

Rarity and Access Adjustments \u2691 As of the start of Pathfinder Society Year 3 (August 2021), all characters have access to the leshy ancestry without requiring a boon. Option Availability Standard \u2691 Ancestries All ancestry options are of standard availability. As the hobgoblin and lizardfolk ancestries are uncommon, this means they are limited to boon access through Chronicle Sheets or the Achievement Point system. The leshy ancestry is open to all characters; however, all other leshy options follow the standard access rules. All other options are of standard availability unless specifically noted otherwise. Limited \u2691 None. Restricted \u2691 Ancestries - Chosen of Lamashtu (page 38). Rulings and Clarifications \u2691 The following rulings and clarifications are based on upcoming errata for this product. The design and development teams have clarified that the ancient elf heritage (page 25) requires an elven lifespan (a feature that half-elves do not have) and thus cannot be selected by half-elves using the Elf Atavism feat (Core Rulebook 58), only by full elves. Clarifying text has been added to the errata for this book. Eclectic Obsession (page 33) should be a single action and have the one-action symbol accordingly. Hobgoblin Weapon Familiarity (page 50) should contain fewer weapons. The updated text should read \u201cYou are trained with composite longbows, composite shortbows, glaives, longbows, longswords, and shortbows.\u201d Leshys with the fungus leshy heritage (page 53) do not have the plant trait listed in the leshy base statistics sidebar, but have the fungus trait instead. The seedpod ranged unarmed attack granted by the Seedpod feat (page 54) has a range increment (not a flat range) of 10 feet. Add Amurrun to the list in the lizardfolk base statistics sidebar (page 57) of additional languages you can choose if you have a positive Intelligence modifier. Impassable Wall Stance (page 90) should have the stance trait. The key spellcasting ability for the spells granted by Invoke the Crimson Oath (page 95) is Charisma.

For the purposes of Society play, the telepathic link created by a deepdread claw (page 28) ends when a Society adventure ends. Per design team clarification, an item animated by the spirit object (page 32) hex uses the spellcaster\u2019s spell DC as its AC. Its Hardness and Hit Points remain unchanged from their normal values as listed on page 577 of the Core Rulebook. If a target of all is one, one is all (page 64) does not consent to the allocation of Hit Points resulting from this spell, they become an unwilling target and they (and their Hit Points) are removed from the spell\u2019s effect. The spell can continue with any remaining targets. Lost Omens Pathfinder Society Guide \u2691 As members of the Pathfinder Society, characters have automatic access to many uncommon options.

The snares created with the Snare Genius kobold ancestry feat (page 15) are temporary items and become unusable after 24 hours or during your next daily preparations, whichever comes first. The Tusks orc ancestry feat (page 18) requires the character to file down their tusks or perform a similar action to retrain; this is part of the normal retraining process and does not take any additional time. The temporary Hit Points granted by the Spell Devourer orc ancestry feat (page 19) are applied as soon as the character succeeds at their saving throw; for an effect that causes Hit Point damage on a successful save, such as a fireball, this means that the character gains the temporary Hit Points before taking damage. Unless specifically noted otherwise, most wands and scrolls are less than 1 foot long and can fit into a ratfolk\u2019s Cheek Pouches (page 22). Per design team clarification, the Homeward Bound gnome feat (page 44) should be of uncommon rarity.

The GM does not need to provide clues for rooms that have no significant secret or hidden features. These clues should indicate only that the character should investigate a given section of the room, not let them automatically uncover the hidden element or provide any additional information beyond signaling its presence. GMs should let a character with the Sense the Unseen investigator feat (page 64) know when the trigger for the ability has been met so they can use the feat if they so choose. Given the slightly relaxed rules around edicts and anathema in Society play, a barbarian with the superstition instinct (page 108) can benefit from spells and magic items if they are an unavoidable part of a Society adventure, such as if a scenario assumes the PCs are transported to their mission location via a teleport spell, or if an adventure requires that all PCs participate in a magical ritual. Per design team clarification, when a barbarian uses the Sunder Spell feat (page 111) against a spell like wall of fire that does not have a listed AC, the Strike hits automatically\u2014the barbarian simply rolls the counteract check. A cavalier (page 184) can pledge to a legal deity, religion, or pantheon, an organization they have access to, or the Pathfinder Society. The edicts and anathema of the Pathfinder Society are as follows: Edicts: Explore important sites, report and record your discoveries, and cooperate with fellow Pathfinders Anathema: Fail to explore, report and cooperate; defy the will of a venture-captain or the Decemvirate A vigilante\u2019s Safe House (page 196), can be located in any city or near any lodge they have received a Pathfinder briefing. A vigilante can use their downtime to relocate their safe house. A vigilante can use their safe house only if it is in the town or location where their current adventure is taking place. The DCs for the Armor Assist feat (page 203) are not subject to GM adjudication. Rather, simply use the default DCs listed in the feat: 15 for common armor, 20 for uncommon armor, and 25 for rare armor. For the purposes of Society play, the Targets entry for the claim undead (page 230) oracle revelation spell is \u201c1 mindless undead creature\u201d, not \u201c1 undead creature.\u201d The intent of this change is to reduce the prevalence of domination magic on sapient creatures in Society play.

As usual for archetypes, players who take the Shieldmarshal dedication feat (page 108) can't select another dedication feat until they have gained two other feats from the Shieldmarshal archetype. Characters who have gained access to the Fey Influence feat from a Pathfinder Society scenario gain access to the expanded version of this feat printed on page 126. This does not grant access to any additional feats in this section. The Jalmeri Heavenseeker archetype as printed in this book (page 224) is legal for play. Players may not use the version printed in Pathfinder #158: Six Feet Under. Arundhat was previously included in Pathfinder Lost Omens: Gods and Magic with ghostly touch as a cleric spell. Players may use either the version from that book or this book, but cannot use both.

allows the players to post in text format once or twice a day. Many players enjoy it as a supplement to their other gaming\u2026 some even consider it the highest form of tabletop gaming! Benefits Allows for deep roleplay, since players can take their time crafting each post An excellent venue for creative players who do not excel at improv Allows for asynchronous play Drawbacks Can be too slow-paced for some (tables vary) Paizo uses BBCode, a deprecated and clunky syntax The Paizo forums were not designed for Play-by-Post, so players sometimes need to leverage hacks and workarounds Avatar art selection is difficult and limited Many players enjoy both play by post and live gaming. As with every other medium, nothing here is exclusive. Creating a Play by Post Alias \u2691 First, register a character. This time, you should select a character image. You can go back and change it later on. Go to Character Image and click Change . There are hundreds of avatars to sort through; try to find one that matches your character's personality. Hover over the one you want and click Select this Avatar. Selecting an avatar. Hover over your selected image and click `Select this Avatar.` Last, click Submit Changes. Use the Avatar Gallery on this site Picking avatars can be a major roadblock due to the nature of the paizo site. We have screen captures of every avatar page here . You should now have an alias that you can select anywhere on the forums. Below every text box is a Post As dropdown, and you can select any aliases there. A post on the new forum alias. Alias vs Character Profile \u2691 This is a common point of confusion on the Paizo website. An alias is not the same thing as a character profile. Let's look at the character we just created by navigating to Organized Play : There are two links circled. The Character's name goes to edit the Profile, and the Edit button takes you to the Alias. As you can see, there are seemingly two ways to edit the character. Which one is which? If you click on the Character Name , you are taken to edit the profile. This profile is what other users see when you post using that alias on the forums, and it is the location where you will be adding character sheet information. If you click on the Edit button, you will be take n to the Alias. You need to edit the Alias to change your character's avatar. Everything else can be edited on the profile. Editing the Character Profile Editing the Character Alias The profile has character information, but does not contain the avatar image. The alias doesn't have your character info for games, but it contains your character's image. Adding Information to your Character \u2691 Play by post typically uses your Paizo character's profile for their character sheet, so filling it out is important. Tp do this, navigate to your character's profile: Hover over My Account and click Organized play Locate the character under My Characters Click the character's name (not the Edit button) Click Edit my Profile You should now be on a page that contains a bunch of text fields that you can fill out. Enter the character's full name in the Full name field. Adding the Slashline \u2691 Next, you want to start filling out your character's slashline. The slashline contains important at-a-glance information that your fellow players and GM will find useful, such as hitpoints, armor, status, and spells. Since the Paizo boards don't have an official slashline, players use the Race and Class/Levels text areas to input this data. With limited character space, it is often written in shorthand (e.g. \"AC\" for \"Armor Class,\" \"HP\" for \"Hit Points,\" etc). If you aren't sure, feel free to ask! Here are copy-paste-able templates for Pathfinder Second Edition, just replace the relevant areas: Pathfinder 2E Slashlines \u2691 Slashline Template for Race Field GENDER CLASS LEVEL | [ b ] Perc [ / b ] + X ( SENSES ) | Speed : X ' | [b]HP:[/b] X/Y | [b]AC:[/b] X (NOTES) | [b]Fort:[/b] +X [b]Ref:[/b] +X [b]Will:[/b] +X (NOTES) Slashline Template for Gender Field | Spells : Foc : X / Y ; 1 : X / Y | Exploration : ACTIVITY | Status : CURRENT_STATUS | Hero Points : X Starfinder Slashlines \u2691 Slashline Template for Race Field (note the space at the start, very important to leave it in) | SP 12/12 HP 14/14 | [ooc] RP 4/4[/ooc] | EAC 15, KAC 16 | [ooc]Fort +0; Ref +6; Will +3[/ooc] | Init: +4 | [ooc]Perc: +6, SM: +6[/ooc] Slashline Template for Classes/Levels Field (note the space at the start, very important to leave it in) | Speed 30ft | [ooc] Reroll: 1/1, Coin 1/1[/ooc] | [ooc]Active conditions: None.[/ooc] Slashline Template for Gender Field [ooc]CG Ysoki Cyberborn Gadgeteer Operative 2[/ooc] The Final Result \u2691 When you are done, your profile should have a lot of information where in the Full Name and Race fields \u2014 it probably looks like a mess, but don't worry. When you actually post it will be formatted nicely: A basic slashline as it appears in a PbP game. Adding the Character's Profile Stats \u2691 When you edit your character's profile, you have many other fields to fill in. This is all optional, but most GMs want you to provide a character sheet they can read. In the About section, you can provide a description of your PC, as well as their character sheet information. There are several templates out there to fill in if you like, or if you are using a service like Hero Lab it can output a stat block for you. Here is how I format my stat blocks; as above, you can copy and paste to use as a starting point. One particular feature of this template is that is uses Paizo forum syntax to create macros for many of the character's abilities, while still being readable.

The only recourse is to start a whole new game thread. Posting Conventions \u2691 Every player and gm has slightly different preferences. However, there are a few best practices. Narrative Text \u2691 When speaking, make it bold and surround it in quotes [b]\"Hello my name is Beef McLarge Huge the fighter\"[/b] said the large huge fighter. When posting internal monologue, use italics [I]\"I really wish I was taller\"[/i] said the fighter. Be descriptive! The main draw of play by post is the opportunity to use evocative language, and really immerse yourself in the setting. When Speaking out of character, flag it as such Clarity is important, but so is flavor and narrative! You can use OOC text to highlight game mechanics while keeping things flavorful in \"normal\" text: Brock Enrol sings an arcane word and then flicks a dollop of butter at the aberration. [ooc]Grease (V, M); DC 16 Reflex save[/ooc]. This is both flavorful from a story perspective, and clear from a mechanical perspective. Provide hooks and push Interact with other PCs while pushing forward with the story. [b]\"Brock, I'm pushing the door open. Get ready in 3\u2026 2\u2026\"[/b] Formatting Dice Rolls \u2691 Dice rolls should be informative and concise. A good standard is to place the attack name, and any modifiers that effect the roll in the description. For example, here are tow attacks being modified by Inspire Courage and Frightened 2: [dice=Club, Cold Iron, Strike 1, Inspire Courage, Frightened 2]1d20 + 4 + 1 -2[/dice] [dice=Bludgeoning, Inspire Courage]1d6 + 4 + 1[/dice] [dice=Club, Cold Iron, Strike 2, Inspire Courage, Frightened 2]1d20 + 4 + 1 -2 -5[/dice] [dice=Bludgeoning, Inspire Courage]1d6 + 4 + 1[/dice] This player wrote Inspire Courage in both their attack and damage roll descriptions. They also included Inspire Courage's +1 bonus, and Frightened 2's -2 penalty, separately, which added extra clarity. In the second Strike's attack roll, they also included the -5 for the Multiple Attack Penalty. This is excellent! Every bonus and penalty to the d20 roll is clear, and the GM can understand how each total was achieved. Note that the player also included the damage type in the damage roll. Including the damage type is important, as enemies often resist or are weak to certain kinds of damage. Reactions and Out-of-Turn Actions \u2691 Reactions, AOOs, and other out-of-turn activities can be tricky in play-by-post. Pre-roll reactions where applicable so the game keeps moving, and designate their trigger, on your turn. (It might help you to make a macro for this, or save text that you can copy/paste somewhere.) For example, a fighter anticipating getting an attack of opportunity on \"Bee Evil\" might write: If Bee Evil moves through a square I threaten: [spoiler=AOO] [dice=Club, Strike 1]1d20 + 2[/dice] [dice=Bludgeoning, Strike 1]1d6 + 2 + 1[/dice] [/spoiler] It is considered good form to place reactions in spoilers to keep the post efficient. At times, you may not want to other players to see your reaction\u2026 in which case the spoiler (and honor system) is a good plan. If you have multiple reactions, note your preference on which one you will take and what the triggers are. For example: Brock has his shield raised and if Bee Evil hits him and does over 15 damage, he will use the block reaction. However, if Mook walks through a threatened square after Big Bad goes, he'll take an AOO: [spoiler=AOO] [dice=Club, Strike 1]1d20 + 2[/dice] [dice=Bludgeoning, Strike 1]1d6 + 2 + 1[/dice] [/spoiler] GMs will generally work with the player to help keep the game flowing smoothly (for example, a defensive-oriented Champion might ask the GM to assume she shield blocks, and automatically reduce the damage for her and note her shield damage). Teamwork is the secret sauce to keeping things flowing and building a repertoire! Rolling Saves \u2691 When asked to roll a save, you should always make it the first dice roll on your next post (or if necessary, rolled in the narrative order of operations). If you do not follow this rule, many GMs will instead roll for you. Use the Discussion Thread \u2691 Most games have a Gameplay thread, and a Discussions thread. The majority of GMs prefer to keep a narrative flowing in the Gameplay thread. It is considered polite to post your questions (or have a discussion) in the Discussions thread instead of gameplay. At times, there may be involved discussions about the rules, and this can derail a game when the back-and-forth appears in the middle of the narrative. Dotting In \u2691 Often you will be asked before the game starts to \u201cdot in.\" This means you post something in the campaign thread, then delete it. This links your character to the gameplay thread so the GM and others can see it in the \"Players\" section of the campaign, and places it in your Campaigns page. After you post something like \"dot!\" in the gameplay thread, go ahead and delete the post to ensure the gameplay thread stays narrative-focused. Round Tokens \u2691 Most play by post GMs use Google Slides. A standard style is to use square tokens for enemies and round tokens for PCs. To make a round token in Slides: Drag your artwork onto the slide Select the image Select the Image Mask option Select the circle shape icon Add a border to the now-masked image Video Example Save Your Hard Work \u2691 It's often a good idea to write your posts in a text editor, or copy and them before hitting Submit. Sometimes, the Paizo forums glitch out, and there is nothing worse than losing a beautiful, long post! Finding games \u2691 The Paizo forums are always recruiting games under the auspices of Organized play! Pathfinder 1e: the Flaxseed Lodge Pathfinder 2e: the Cottonseed Lodge Starfinder: Castamir's Flaxseed Station Read the GM's Profile \u2691 Every gm has different conventions and needs. When you join a game, click on the GM's profile and read anything they've written. Make sure they seem like a good fit for you and that you can make any accommodations they ask for (for example, some GMs are colorblind and prefer dice split across separate lines). One of the most important considerations is how often the GM expects you to post. Do not sign up for a game if the Gm expects you to post daily, and you cannot commit to that. Find a game that fits your desired pace. Follow Instructions \u2691 GMs will need you to sign in if it's for an Organized Play game. They often use slides to to determine marching order, character info, secret checks, and the like. Try to be timely about getting them all the info they need, and don't be shy about asking for help. Campaigns Tab \u2691 When you find a game to join, the GM will provide you with a forum link. You can \"dot in\" on the gameplay thread so it shows up on your campaigns tab. Any game you've played in will show up there, too. To get to your campaigns tab: Sign in Click on My Profile Click on Campaigns Here, you should see all the campaigns associated with all of your characters. You can click on any campaign to go to the game.

They also included Inspire Courage's +1 bonus, and Frightened 2's -2 penalty, separately, which added extra clarity. In the second Strike's attack roll, they also included the -5 for the Multiple Attack Penalty. This is excellent! Every bonus and penalty to the d20 roll is clear, and the GM can understand how each total was achieved. Note that the player also included the damage type in the damage roll. Including the damage type is important, as enemies often resist or are weak to certain kinds of damage.","title":"Formatting Dice Rolls"},{"location":"pbp/play-by-post/#reactions-and-out-of-turn-actions","text":"Reactions, AOOs, and other out-of-turn activities can be tricky in play-by-post. Pre-roll reactions where applicable so the game keeps moving, and designate their trigger, on your turn. (It might help you to make a macro for this, or save text that you can copy/paste somewhere.) For example, a fighter anticipating getting an attack of opportunity on \"Bee Evil\" might write: If Bee Evil moves through a square I threaten: [spoiler=AOO] [dice=Club, Strike 1]1d20 + 2[/dice] [dice=Bludgeoning, Strike 1]1d6 + 2 + 1[/dice] [/spoiler] It is considered good form to place reactions in spoilers to keep the post efficient. At times, you may not want to other players to see your reaction\u2026 in which case the spoiler (and honor system) is a good plan. If you have multiple reactions, note your preference on which one you will take and what the triggers are. For example: Brock has his shield raised and if Bee Evil hits him and does over 15 damage, he will use the block reaction. However, if Mook walks through a threatened square after Big Bad goes, he'll take an AOO: [spoiler=AOO] [dice=Club, Strike 1]1d20 + 2[/dice] [dice=Bludgeoning, Strike 1]1d6 + 2 + 1[/dice] [/spoiler] GMs will generally work with the player to help keep the game flowing smoothly (for example, a defensive-oriented Champion might ask the GM to assume she shield blocks, and automatically reduce the damage for her and note her shield damage).

The task is often repetitive; while there are many ways to work with assets, the best solution is whatever is easiest for you \u2014 be that automation with lots of features, free websites, or lo-fi assets that just get the job done. A note on Size \u2691 Many VTTs are used by vision-disabled players. Many VTTs are also used by players with slow internet speed. GMs should find a balance between image size (larger is better for low-vision players, who need to zoom), and speed. I try to keep maps under 500kb, and tokens under 300. There is no one correct answer\u2026 it depends on your group and context; for example, some groups prefer gorgeous high-res maps that can be megabytes in size. Other groups prefer a lo-fi, snappier experience that more closely mimics an in-person tabletop session. Talk to your group, ask for feedback, and find out what works for them. A note on Design \u2691 Simpler is better. Err on the side of simple, clear tokens. A complex and beautiful token is just noise if it is unrecognizable when the map is zoomed out. Use more than border colors to designate tokens. Roll20 and other VTTs have many options for naming tokens, such as numbering tokens. In Play-by-Post / Google Slides, many GMs colorize token borders, and forget their players may have vision disabilities such as colorblindness. Google Slides offers a variety of options at your disposal to achieve clarity such as numbering tokens, using dashed / solid / dotted borders, and making them into shapes. Consistency is Clarity. Many GMs prefer to use square tokens for enemies, and round tokens for PCs. Whatever your table's preference, maintain consistency throughout your games. Your design preference will become a language of its own. Extracting & Editing Images \u2691 All image editing requires unlocking the Paizo PDF. To unlock the PDF, export the pdf to pdf in Preview.app (macOS) or in Foxit reader (Windows)by choosing File => Print => PDF ). You now have a new file that you can use for image extraction. Free: Acrobat Reader DC \u2691 Open the unlocked PDF in Acrobat reader DC Right-Click the image Select Copy Image You can now paste the image into any app on your computer (e.g. Paint / Photoshop), or paste into Google Slides The image may turn out upside-down or with a black background. If that is the case, try one of the batch extraction tools below; these should work better. Why is there a black background on my image? PDFs don't support images with transparency. Instead publishers like Paizo use two images; one of them is a transparency mask that mimics the desired effect, and the other is the image itself. When you copy an image, sometimes you only get the RGB data and the background therefore comes out black. To fix this you need to get editing software such as Photoshop/Gimp, or use a free tool like the ones below to do the job for you. Subscription: Adobe CC \u2691 The benefit of Adobe Creative Cloud is that all the apps can sync up and let you do advanced editing. This is the author's preferred way of working with assets. Extract the Image with Transparency \u2691 Open the unlocked PDF in Acrobat Pro Click Tools and Edit PDF Right-click the image Select Edit Using => Adobe Photoshop Click Yes on the warning window that appears The image with transparency is ready in Photoshop You can save the image as a PNG, and use it in your VTT of choice. Extracting an image with transparency using Adobe CC products Batch Extracting Images \u2691 Batch exporting images is often less useful, as the export will get all art assets (including decorative images, such as those in the margins of pages). However, it can be useful at times. Subscription: Adobe CC \u2691 Unlock the PDF (export the pdf to pdf in Preview.app (macOS) or File => Print => PDF in Foxit reader) Open the PDF in Acrobat Click Tools Click Export PDF Click Image Click your file type (note alpha will not preserved, no matter what) Click Export all images Click Export Choose the directory if needed Let the software run https://gfycat.com/victoriousoccasionalantarcticfurseal Free: I \u2665 PDF \u2691 Sites such as these are free to use, but their performance may not always be reliable. Unlock the PDF (export the pdf to pdf in Preview.app (macOS) or File => Print => PDF in Foxit reader) Go to ilovepdf.com Drag the PDF onto the page Click Extract Images Click Convert to JPG Click Download all JPG Images on the screen when ready Token Creation \u2691 There are several free websites you can use to create tokens; there is no best website. Find one you like. The Fateful Force Token Stamp 2 Token Tool 2 Google Slides (native with many Play-by-Post games) Free: Google Slides with Play-by-Post \u2691 If you have an image without transparency and are using Google Slides for your VTT, (for example, batch-extracted images with a white background), you can drag them onto Google slides and edit them to create tokens using the slides masking tool . Drag your image onto the slide Select the image by clicking on it Click the Mask button (it looks like a two right-angle lines intersecting to create a box) The image should now be highlighted, with the corners and edges covered with thick dark lines Drag the lines over the area you want removed from the token (you can also drag the image round behind the masking pane to adjust) Hit Enter. If you want a circular token, click on the Masks icon again and select Shapes => Circle You can add a border and numbers if you want Google Slides token creation \u2691 Free: Fateful Force \u2691 The Fateful Force VTT Token Maker is a simple-to-use token creator that has basic options as well as text. Drag your image onto the canvas Select your border Select your background (note, if your image doesn't have transparency this should match the background of your original art; often this is white [ #fff ]) Add text and scale the text if desired. Useful for multiple enemies of the same type. Download Fateful Force token creation \u2691 Square Tokens \u2691 To make a square token, just select None under \"Border Style.\" This will create a square token without a border for you. Subscription: Adobe Photoshop \u2691 Building a token in Photoshop allows you to customize in a variety of ways. You can find a font and style that you want. One of the benefits of Photoshop is automation. Building tokens is a repetitive task; the Photoshop Actions pane allows you to save your workflow for future use. Here is how to make a token in photoshop. You can use these steps for automation. Note that this is a destructive process, so if you want to save the art make a backup or do less automation by using tools like the Crop tool, but not checking Delete Cropped pixels. Add a new layer background: Layer => New Fill Layer => Solid Color => OK => enter fff in the highlighted text box => OK Drag the layer under the current layer Select the Rectangular Marquee tool Hold down Shift and drag out a square Select Image => Crop (note this is a destructive way of cropping; use the Crop tool if you want a destructive way of doing this, but note that it will be much harder to automate) Select the layers in the layers panel Hit Command + Option + Shift + E (mac) or Ctrl + Alt + Shift + E (Windows) to merge the selected layers Size the new image Select Image => Image Size Set the resolution to 72 (this is important for automation purposes! If your images are not all the same resolution your strokes and placement will be thrown off) Set the image size. 400 x 400 px is a good size Right click the top layer (the merged layer) and select Blending Options Click Stroke , select Inside , and set it to 12 px (or whatever you think looks good). You can change the stroke color to whatever you want, but I think black is simple and best. Number the token (optional) Select the text tool, and click inside the image. Enter a number. Size the text to so looks good, so you can see the number and the art Change the text color to white ( fff ) Right click the top layer and select Blending Options Click Stroke and this time select Outside instead of Inside, and it to 6 px (or whatever you think looks good) Now that you can see the number, adjust the placement, font size, and font to your liking. I like Taroca (free) because it matches the 2e rulebooks' heading text. Save the image. Double-click the number and add another number. Copy/Paste into Google Slides to Save Time You can select all and Copy Merged ( Edit => Copy merged ) and paste directly into Google Slides. There is no need to save your work onto the hard drive. This is a huge time saver for PbP GMs! Building a token by hand in Photoshop \u2691 Round Tokens \u2691 Add a new layer background: Layer => New Fill Layer => Solid Color => OK => enter fff in the highlighted text box => OK Drag the layer under the current layer Select the Elliptical Marquee tool Holding down Shift, drag a circle out over the area you want Select the layers in the layers panel Hit Command + Option + Shift + E (mac) or Ctrl + Alt + Shift + E (Windows) to merge the selected layers Hide the layers below this merged layer by clicking on the eye markers next to those layers Click Select => Select and Mask Scroll down and under Output To click on the dropdown and select New Layer Click OK Right click the layer and select Blending Options Click Stroke and add your stroke and color Click Trim => Transparent Pixels Save or copy to Google Slides This is also easy to automate (see below), but you need to start with your merged layer if the image has transparency. The author of this guide uses round tokens for PCs and square for NPCs, so it is not a use-case that comes up as often. Automation \u2691 The above work is not very feasible for a busy GM. However, automation is a powerful tool Photoshop users have at their disposal. Repeat the steps above while recording a new action, and you should be able to make this repetitive task a breeze. There are a couple \"gotchas\" to be aware of so your action works with any file: While recording, re-name your base layer to something that makes sense. The action's steps will break unless the layers being moved and merged have the same names every time. Size all images the to the same dimensions and resolution , and capture that in the action. I set all tokens to a 72 resolution, then I size the image to 400px wide. This keeps stroke and font placement consistent. Start your action after a selection is made. You cannot automate selecting the token area very well \u2014 that takes a human eye. An automated workflow \u2691 This workflow does all of the above (size, stroke, stroked numbering) with two clicks, from a selection of transparent artwork. Removing Backgrounds \u2691 Sometimes you may need to remove backgrounds from images in Photoshop. For example, you received flattened assets without transparency. or, perhaps you don't have access to Acrobat but you have access to Photoshop. Luckily, tools like the Magic Eraser make things go quickly. The Magic Eraser Tool \u2691 Removing background in Photoshop is quite easy using tools like the Magic Eraser. This is often the best choice for simple images, or images where speed is your primary goal. Hide the background layer by clicking the eye in the layers panel Click on the Magic Eraser tool Click on the background areas to remove it If too much of the image you want to keep is removed, adjust the Threshold (in the top left on your task bar); a Threshold of 15 is a good starting point. Your image now has transparency. Quickly removing the background in Photoshop \u2691 Masking Images \u2691 Sometimes a complicated image warrants a a little more effort. This is the case for images with complicated edges, such as creatures with hair or auras. This is when masking comes into play. I do not use this option unless two conditions are met: the creature is narratively important, and the artwork is complex. Click the Quick Selection tool Click the brush at the top to set a lower tolerance (usually something around 10 is good) Select the areas you want to keep Work to refine the edges. If you select too much, use the Option (macOS) key or Alt key (Windows) to deselect the range. Take as long as you like on refining the selection. This can take anywhere from a few seconds to many minutes, depending on how detailed you wish to be. Click the Mask button at the bottom of the Layers pane. Click Refine Play with the settings until you are happy with the image. I like to smooth and feather just a little bit, and check off Decontaminate Colors. Click OK. Masking an image in Photoshop \u2691 Maps \u2691 Maps can be extracted like images. When importing to a VTT like roll20, it is a good idea to first remove partial squares from the edges. This helps the map line up perfectly with the VTT's grid. You can use image editor like Photoshop to crop the image, or a free online editor such as I love Image to crop your asset. After it is cropped, simply count the height and width in squares, and create your canvas in that same size. Everything should line up perfectly. Maps for Roll20 \u2691 Use Preview or photoshop to crop out partial grid suares. Set he canvas in Roll20 the the same height and width, in grid squares. Upload the cropped map and expand it to fill the canvas. Everything should line up. Maps on Google Slides \u2691 It is a best practice to use background images for Google Slides, so players can move tokens and create auras or notes without disrupting the gameplay board. Locked backgrounds are also an accessibility need for players with muscular disabilities. To avoid skewing, the image must be sized to fit. You can do this with image editing software like Photoshop, or online tools like croppola . Making 16:9 Maps in Photoshop \u2691 Start with your image open Select the Crop tool In the top right bar, to the right of Ratio enter 16, hit Tab and enter 9. This is your aspect ratio The 16:9 crop box should be viewable on the image Resize the image so it covers the area you want You can drag the image round to reposition it in the crop box Hit enter twice Save the cropped image In Google Slides, right click on your slide and select 1Change background.` Select Choose Image Upload your 16:9 image to slides Note that on Google Slides you can also create 4:4 slides. In that case, replace 16:9 with 4:3 in the instructions above.

Back in the days of true pen and paper gaming, the GM could simply print a copy of the chronicle for each player and fill it out at the table. This model no longer works in many cases, as online gaming and paperless accounting have become more prevalent. However, Paizo's scenarios are copyright protected, so you can't easily edit them! Services like RPG Chronicles can build your chronicles for you as well. Making Chronicles with Free Software \u2691 This guide will use Preview, the default PDF reader for macOS, but the steps will also work for Foxit Reader on Windows as well as many other readers of choice (including swanky ones like Acrobat Pro). Whatever software you prefer the general method is the same: you extract a single page from the PDF and edit it with the base info like event number, and then make copies and fill them out with player specifics. To achieve this, you will use the Print to PDF feature that ships with common software or is built into your OS. Extract the Page \u2691 Click File => Print Name the file, and save it in a directory that you can find It's a good idea to create a directory for your chronicles, as you will be creating up to 7 of these things! Print to PDF as it appears on macOS. On Foxit it likely appears on the \"Printer\" dropdown.

A chronicle directory on a computer; note the file names are clear and understandable. Share the Chronicles \u2691 Share the chronicles in whatever way is easiest for you. Some GMs prefer uploading them to a Google Drive folder; others prefer sending them out manually via email. Whatever is easiest for you is best\u2026 it's a lot of work! Making Chronicles with RPG Chronicles \u2691 RPG Chronicles lets you sign up for free and generate chronicles; you need to own the PDF and upload a special code that's on the chronicle sheet. See the how it works guide on RPG Chronicles. Finding the Code Make sure to close tags; there is a forum bug where if you leave a [b] tag open, it makes the entire game bold \u2014 and it cannot be undone! The only recourse is to start a whole new game thread. Location of the Chronicle Code on the chronicle (the code is blurred out here); look on the bottom of the chronicle to find the code. Sending the information to the reporter \u2691 If you're not reporting, make sure to Make sure to send the information to the designated reporter for the event. There is a Save Reporting Information button on the Chronicles and Reporting page that will copy all the info to your clipboard. A note on Accessibility \u2691 The author tested the chronicles with text annotation on Preview.app as well as RPG Chronicles. MacOS VoiceOver picked up all the added text in both instances. However, the items on the PDF came through in the incorrect order. This seems to be an issue with the PDF structure and/or tags. There is not much a GM can do about it. As always, try to do your best and keep in mind text annotation is better than a hand-written chronicle when dealing with digital assets. Final Thoughts \u2691 There is often a tradeoff between convenience and ease of use; those who GM often may find services such as RPG Chronicles convenient. VOs who report many games may even find the paid version of RPG Chronicles convenient, as it offers a Google Chrome extension that does one-click reporting for you. On the other hand, many GMs get by just fine by practicing, refining their workflows, and gaining proficiency with the tools they have available. Some GMs claim they can generate PDFs by hand in just a couple of minutes. As always, there isn't one right way to do it: do whatever you can to get players chronicles quickly, with as little pain as possible.","title":"Splitting Chronicles"},{"location":"vtt/splitting-chronicles/#creating-splitting-chronicles","text":"","title":"Creating &amp; Splitting Chronicles"},{"location":"vtt/splitting-chronicles/#making-chronicles-with-free-software","text":"This guide will use Preview, the default PDF reader for macOS, but the steps will also work for Foxit Reader on Windows as well as many other readers of choice (including swanky ones like Acrobat Pro).

The term \"Virtual Tabletop\" is often abbreviated as \"VTT.\" This guide will provide an overview of the most popular VTTs, as well as general considerations. Which VTT is Best for Us? \u2691 Note the question isn't \"Which VTT is right for me \u2014 it's us. Choosing a VTT should be a group endeavor whenever possible, as it will impact everyone's enjoyment of the game. For online gamers, the VTT choice can an output of Session 0 . Campaigns where the VTT is chosen ahead of time (often due to GM preference) should put that up-front in their recruiting literature, letting players decide. An example of this are one-off Pathfinder or Starfinder scenarios that are open to the public for signup; and players are free to attend a different game if they cannot use the GM's platform of choice. Roll20 \u2691 Combat in Roll20. Roll20 is the most popular VTT; it offers standard tools and is free. However, many users have moved away from Roll20 because of its bugs and slower development cycles. In addition, the Roll20 subscription model is essentially required in many cases \u2014 especially for GMs who wish to use their API. That said, Roll20 is still the most popular option out there as it's free to start playing and packed with features that are now expected in many VTTs. Cost \u2691 Roll20 has a tiered subscription model. While it tours a free-to-play system, active GMs will run out of space quickly. For Organized Play, access to the Character Vault for portability between games helps many players (but is not required). Feature Free Plus Pro Asset Space 100 MB 3 GB 6 GB Ad-Free Dynamic Lighting Custom Character Sheets API Access Dev Server Character Vault YEARLY COST $0 $50 $100 Pros, Cons, Audience \u2691 Roll20's entry floor lower than other VTTs, but so is the ceiling. It's a great fit for GMs who want a basic VTT, have a budget, and do not want to tinker with port forwarding, automation, or server creation. Pros Core is stable and works well, even on lower-end computers Users don't need to be tech-savvy Community made sheets for many games Reasonable subscription price Partnerships with Paizo to put adventures on marketplace More accessible for disabled users than most other VTTs Most portability of standard VTTs qith the character vault (subscription required) It can be challenging for users intimidated by technology or on a limited setup. Cons Slow development cycle for new features and requests Features often don't work as intended, such as uploading and asset management API only avialable from the top-tier subscription Subscription model makes exporting your own content difficult Lighting effects and animations are not optimized from a code perspective Content is not free (and rather expensive), compared to Foundry where it's mostly free so long as you own the PDF Who Will Love It Who Will Hate It GMs who want a VTT that offers the basics, with a lower learning curve Players who want complex macros and dice syntax Users who do not have nice computers Users using screen readers (paired with GMs putting in the extra work to format text correctly) People with a budget to buy first-party material on the marketplace Users playing indie RPGs Users who want something simple Users who demand an attentive development cycle Users who want easy-to-set-up animations and dynamic lighting Users who want a sleek UI Foundry \u2691 The Foundry UI. Foundry is a standalone, self-hosted application that uses modern web technologies and has a large community of developers. Cost \u2691 The Foundry license is a $50 one-time license for the GM; they can then invite players to their server. While Foundry is touted as a low-cost solution, keep in mind there may be other costs on top of this. A self-hosted Foundry setup requires the host to let others directly connect to their computer while the game is running, which can expose the user to security risks as well as technical challenges. It is a good idea to purchase strong antivirus software, a new and up-to-date modem, etc. Several options exist to host for free (Oracle Always Free, AWS Free Tier), or for comparable pricing of Partner Hosted (Digital Ocean droplets start at $5 which meet the minimum requirement, but the recommended specs require a $10 droplet), or any similar service. Feature Self-Hosted Partner Hosted Cloud Hosted Software License $50.00 $50.00 $50.00 Monthly Hosting $4-12 $0-20 Game Access While GM is running app Cost Variable At all times Setup Difficulty Med Low High Security Risk Med Low Low 1st YEAR COST $50 $98-194 $50-290 Pros, Cons, Audience \u2691 Foundry is a great fit for a group of people who are versed in tech and have decent desktop computers. Pros One-time software license for GM only Powerful and customizable Rich plugin ecosystem Walls/lighting are super fast and intuitive to set up More intuitive UX than most other VTTs Paizo published character options and statblocks are included in systems for free Players who want complex macros and dice syntax Constant updates from an active developer community It can be challenging for users intimidated by technology or on a limited setup. Cons Requires a fast computer with a large screen; the system requirements are more aligned with a computer game than a VTT Requires use of browser that supports WebGL 2.0. Notably iPad or iPhone IOS versions earlier than 14.5 do not support this. Technical / DevOps skills are required for setup and maintenance, or a monthly subscription with variable rates that can get expensive Accessibility is lacking for screen readers Lack of native portability for PCs makes running games in Organized Play difficult Constant updates mean the GM needs to keep their server and plugins maintained and can sometimes cause issues Who Will Love It Who Will Hate It GMs who are interested in web/server technology A group of people with gaming computers Users who want to tinker with tons of options and features GMs who want to quickly import official content, for free Users who want something simple GMs who aren't comfortable with web technology GMs who don't want to tinker or futz with the details Users who do not have nice computers Users with disabilities Fantasy Grounds \u2691 The Fantasy Grounds UI. (source: Rise of the Runelords Anniversary Edition product page) Fantasy Grounds is almost 20 years old, and has a loyal following. It offers extensive automation, but is also rather expensive. Cost \u2691 Fantasy Grounds is feature-rich, and users pay for that. unlike other VTTs, Fantasy Grounds is set up in such a way that all users need to have a subscription or license to participate. The GM can, however, purchase Fantasy Grounds Unlimited and let players play for free (they still need Fantasy Grounds accounts and demo licenses of the software). Feature Standard Subscription Unlimited Subscription Standard License (one time) Unlimited License (one time) Players Play Free (with Demo) YEARLY COST $48 / Person $120 $39 / Person $149 Pros, Cons, Audience \u2691 Fantasy Grounds is an excellent choice for players who enjoy automation and enjoy the old-school UI. Pros Tons of features Automation galore Native 3-D Dice One-time purchase option Developers are actively fixing bugs and adding features Established and active community Offers official adventures for Pathfinder Cons More expensive than other options, and players need to have a demo or license Dated UI with lots of popup windows Automation can get in the way of homebrew Fewer character sheets than other systems Who Will Love It Who Will Hate It GMs who want lots of automation for crunchy games like Pathfinder Users who want to own the software and the games Users who are invested in taking their time to really master a powerful system Users who want something simple Users on small screens Users constrained by cost Users playing indie RPGs Google Slides \u2691 A Google Slides map. Note the initiative tracker template added by hand by the GM. Google slides can be used as a bare-bones VTT. Essentially, the GM creates a set of slides with backgrounds set to the map, and allows anyone to edit it/ Players create tokens for their PCs and move them around on the map, rolling dice at their table. Cost \u2691 Google Slides is free to use; the GM should own a Google Account to edit the slides. In addition, the group needs to set up some kind of voice or VTT, so a Discord server may need to be acquired. Pros, Cons, Audience \u2691 Google Slides can be a fast way to get a VTT off the ground, and it's used by the play-by-post.md community, but it lacks almost al the features modern players tend to expect when it comes to a VTT. Though free, users need to have some kind of voice setup such as a discord server. Finally, users with muscular or vision disabilities may have difficulty interacting with the slides. Pros Quickly set up tables No experience needed to use Very old-school/minimalist feeling Free Works on all browsers and devices Cons Editing is a slower process than other VTTs Lack of features such as initiative trackers can slow down games Players and GMs need to trust one another as dice are rolled off-screen Poor support for users with disabilities (can be mitigated by GM, but it takes extra work such as fitting backgrounds to slides) Who Will Love It Who Will Hate It Users who also play on play-by-post Users who want simple technology Users who want old-school games Users looking to occasionally supplement their in-person gaming with a \"minimum viable product\" Users who want full-featured VTTs Users who are bad at doing math with physical dice GMs who don't trust their players (and vice versa)","title":"Choosing a VTT"},{"location":"vtt/vtts-overview/#virtual-tabletops","text":"Since the pandemic, many players have transitioned to Virtual Tabletop games.

Creating an Event \u2691 To create an event, click on Submit an Event. Then, name the event. Tip Keep in mind that the event name will also be a hotlink on the Warhorn site to your event\u2019s page, so make sure to name it something easily identifiable. For example, a lodge at the Ellsworth station in Antarctica might be named \u201cEllsworth Antarctica Organized Play.\u201d Next, set the event as a one-time event or recurring event. By default, the This is a one-time event box is checked and requires a date or date range to be entered. If your event is to be recurring, uncheck the one-time event box. No dates will be required for entry at this time (this will be handled later). Nest, provide an event location (blended online and in-person event setup is possible with the software and is set up during the scheduling of a session). If it is to be held online, put a check in the This event is held online box. If the event is to be an in-person event, leave the This event is held online box unchecked. If the event is to be a blend of in-person and online, it is your choice how to handle the This event is held online box, but best practice would be to make sure to add to the details of the event that it will be both. If the event is to be private, check the This event is private box. nest, place any additional comments in the comments box. It may be considered best practice to make sure to include any rules your lodge has for signing up or any other rules that players should know before they decide to join. Finally, select either Submit your event with a donation or Submit your event for free . Event Dashboard \u2691 Wait for Warhorn staff to email you to tell you your event site is live. This will give you access to the event dashboard. When you have access, you should be able to see new dropdowns on the top right of the screen: Tools icon : Here you can manage the schedule, scenarios, registrations, venues, fees, and archive or delete your event. List icon : Here you can manage the event's setup, including the Title, Contact, Dates, Location, Details, Fee Settings, Roles, Options, and Integrations. Make any alterations needed to finish setting up the event by first clicking the Setup dropdown button at the top right of the screen. These might include: Title (if changes are needed) Your contact information Dates (again, this will only be required for a one-time event) Location Details (This is where you can get specific about the event, and should contain enough information for players to know how your event will work.) Fee Settings (If your event requires any participation fees, whether a badge fee, a table fee, charitable donation fee, or any other fee, players and GMs alike should be made aware in advance.) Set up Roles \u2691 Each role has predefined permissions that you can customize. They include managing the event, managing the session, and viewing [player information. Default roles are: Attendee GM Staff You can assign additional roles as you see fit. it is considered a best practice to not allow players to see one another's personal information such as email or discord usernames. Tip Some hybrid events create custom roles like \"In-Person Player\" and \"Online Player\" to differentiate players who play at the local game store versus those who play online; another example might be a local and non-local player. Roles are a great way to customize your events. Opening the Event \u2691 When the event is ready, put a check in the box labeled Attendees can register for this event. Optionally, you can also have a custom registration message sent to anyone when they register for the event. A custom message can be a good way to welcome players. The Discord connection is set to Ignore by default, meaning attendees are not required to have their Discord account connected to their Warhorn account, however, it is highly suggested that for online events this be changed to Required if your lodge uses Discord for voice chat. Signup options \u2691 There are several options available to organizers. You can automatically clear registrants to participate (leaving this box unchecked makes it require a manual review and approval) You can enable a GM Signup List Additionally, as with Roles, you can permit the GM to manage the details of their sessions and/or allow GMs to see participation contact info by checking the appropriate boxes here, which will then be used as the default permissions for every GM sign up. Enable waitlisting can be used for two primary reasons: to let players sign up in case of someone backing out, and to gauge player interest. If the waitlist size warrants it, it would be advisable to attempt to find additional GM(s), if the desire is there to play at the specifically set date and time Alternatively, if there is no desire by all players to play at the scheduled date and time, it could be used to set up an additional session at another time. Waitlists are ordered automatically (first in, first out) by Warhorn, and cannot be altered by event staff. In the event, a new session is added and it will pull players from the waitlist, which will be automated based on signup order. Enable monthly calendar view \u2691 Enabling the monthly calendar view will allow users to look at your scheduled sessions by either an Agenda view or a Calendar view, permitting them to jump to specific dates. Services \u2691 This specific setting is only useful if you have a Facebook page, which then adds a Facebook Like button or box to your event page. Manage the Event \u2691 The button immediately to the left of the Setup button is the Manage button. This button allows you to make changes to the schedule, scenarios, registrations, venues, and registration fees (each has its listing on the dropdown menu). Note: - For ongoing games, such as Organized Play games, the two that will be used most frequently will be Schedule and Scenarios . Manage Schedule \u2691 To add your first session, click on the Add The Next Occurrence button. In the new window, set the start date, start time, time zone, and session duration, and hit save. Once the occurrence is added, click the Add Another Slot button if you plan to have multiple sessions, and repeat the above steps. Click on the time slot that is now under the date of your occurrence On this new screen, click on Add A Session In the new window, select the scenario you are planning to run for this slot (I would advise following the steps in the Manage Scenarios area before the Manage Schedule area, as the official scenarios that can be chosen in this section need to be added before scheduling them to link directly to the scenario description and information on Paizo\u2019s website) by beginning to type it in. (Starfinder\u2019s prefix is SFS. Pathfinder prefixes are PF1 and PF2, respectively.) Select or verify the language the game will be run in Set the number of tables and number of players per table (keeping in mind that the maximum number of OP players, by rule, is 6) Add any specific notes for the session and scenario Make sure there is a check next to Active before saving, or your new session will not show on the agenda or calendar views of your event. Click on the Scenario name link that will have now been created to manage the session further. For Online Games : If possible indicate which VTT is in use as well as where the Discord server information and invitations will be placed for online games. You can also set up session specific-permissions for each role vs. the global permissions previously mentioned. Click on Add Virtual Tabletop and select the appropriate choice from the list. Note: There is an Other choice, in the event the one you use is not listed. Input the appropriate server information or link for web apps to share with players. Note: - For Fantasy Grounds Unity, you will also need to choose if this is a Cloud or a LAN game and provide the GM Name and the table password, if there is one. Provide the name of the VTT (Mine is named \u201cStarfinder Society Organized Play\u201d, and users will search for me either by my GM name, the VTT name, or both) Add any notes and hit save Add Voice/Chat Services, if you are using any Select the appropriate service from the dropdown menu Provide the Server Invite Link (for Discord, you will also need to provide the names of the text and voice channels, as well as any invitation links for the specific channels). Add the Server Name, any notes you feel applicable, and hit save. For In-Person events, it will work similarly, choosing the venues previously added instead of choosing a VTT and Voice service. It is possible to use this feature to set up a singular event for a lodge, adding all VOs as Staff to then give them access to schedule their sessions instead of each need to set up their event. Boston PFS is already doing this. Manage Scenarios \u2691 Before you can schedule games, you must first add scenarios. This is achieved in the manage Scenarios area. Add Global Scenarios \u2691 This option has access to Paizo\u2019s database of scenarios to choose from to add to your event. Pathfinder is broken out into PF1 and PF2 as the prefixes, and either AP or Mod to select adventure paths or scenarios. Starfinder\u2019s prefix is SF and is broken out as AP, Mod (currently only used for the Free RPG Day Skitter Adventures), or SFS #-##, with the numbers indicating the season and scenario number. To add a scenario, start typing the system's prefix, followed by the scenario number or type. You can also type in the scenario name, and it should pick it up. You will need to do this every time Paizo comes out with new scenarios, or you want to run something your event hasn't run before. Add Custom Scenarios \u2691 Provide the scenario name Leave checked or remove the check (as required) from the box indicating if this is an Organized Play Campaign Scenario. Type in a few characters for the game system Optional fields can be used to include the following: Author Min Level Max Level Number of players per table Scenario blurb Cover art image URL External URL Custom Copy Manage Registrations \u2691 In this section, you can clear people to sign up for sessions (if you do not have automatic clearing turned on), unclear them (if need be), or add registrations. This section also shows you if any of the users have not paid their fee (if there is one). Note A note on adding registrations - if the user you are attempting to add to your event already has an account on Warhorn, this will not work, as using this action creates a new Warhorn account for the user credentials you are submitting. By clicking on an existing registered user\u2019s name on the list, you will be able to go into their registration and add them to roles other than the default Attendee role. Manage Venues \u2691 Here, you can add in-person venues, public or private, for inclusion in your event. You will need the following information to add a venue: Venue name Address City Country State Zip Code Phone Number Be sure to review the Visibility area of the venue entry, as it defaults to the public, permitting anyone on the site to see the address and phone number of the venue, which you may not want if you\u2019re also using this for your home game and put in your personal information for the venue information. Registration Fees \u2691 To add a Base fee: Set a name for the fee Set the fee amount Default fee, Public fee, and Active fee. If there's one public active base fee, it will be automatically selected at registration time. If there is more than one public active base fee, the registrant will be required to select one of them, and the one chosen as default will be preselected. To add an Extra fee or Discount: Set a name for the fee Set the fee amount Public fee, and Active Fee (there is help text on the site about these, though some of it is not very clear, aside from that leaving the box checked for Public Fee makes it open for everyone on the site to see, and the others may only truly apply if you have a fee structure or discounted fees based on volunteering or early sign-ups). Note An Extra fee or Discount will only show up if at least one public active extra fee/discount is configured. Each of these is an optional selection for the registrant.","title":"For Organizers"},{"location":"warhorn/warhorn-for-organizers/#warhorn-for-organizers","text":"","title":"Warhorn for Organizers"},{"location":"warhorn/warhorn-for-organizers/#creating-an-event","text":"To create an event, click on Submit an Event.
