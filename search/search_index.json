The task is often repetitive; while there are many ways to work with assets, the best solution is whatever is easiest for you \u2014 be that automation with lots of features, free websites, or lo-fi assets that just get the job done. A note on Size \u2691 Many VTTs are used by vision-disabled players. Many VTTs are also used by players with slow internet speed. GMs should find a balance between image size (larger is better for low-vision players, who need to zoom), and speed. I try to keep maps under 500kb, and tokens under 300. There is no one correct answer\u2026 it depends on your group and context; for example, some groups prefer gorgeous high-res maps that can be megabytes in size. Other groups prefer a lo-fi, snappier experience that more closely mimics an in-person tabletop session. Talk to your group, ask for feedback, and find out what works for them. A note on Design \u2691 Simpler is better. Err on the side of simple, clear tokens. A complex and beautiful token is just noise if it is unrecognizable when the map is zoomed out. Use more than border colors to designate tokens. Roll20 and other VTTs have many options for naming tokens, such as numbering tokens. In Play-by-Post / Google Slides, many GMs colorize token borders, and forget their players may have vision disabilities such as colorblindness. Google Slides offers a variety of options at your disposal to achieve clarity such as numbering tokens, using dashed / solid / dotted borders, and making them into shapes. Consistency is Clarity. Many GMs prefer to use square tokens for enemies, and round tokens for PCs. Whatever your table's preference, maintain consistency throughout your games. Your design preference will become a language of its own. Extracting & Editing Images \u2691 All image editing requires unlocking the Paizo PDF. To unlock the PDF, export the pdf to pdf in Preview.app (macOS) or in Foxit reader (Windows)by choosing File => Print => PDF ). You now have a new file that you can use for image extraction. Free: Acrobat Reader DC \u2691 Open the unlocked PDF in Acrobat reader DC Right-Click the image Select Copy Image You can now paste the image into any app on your computer (e.g. Paint / Photoshop), or paste into Google Slides The image may turn out upside-down or with a black background. If that is the case, try one of the batch extraction tools below; these should work better. Why is there a black background on my image? PDFs don't support images with transparency. Instead publishers like Paizo use two images; one of them is a transparency mask that mimics the desired effect, and the other is the image itself. When you copy an image, sometimes you only get the RGB data and the background therefore comes out black. To fix this you need to get editing software such as Photoshop/Gimp, or use a free tool like the ones below to do the job for you. Subscription: Adobe CC \u2691 The benefit of Adobe Creative Cloud is that all the apps can sync up and let you do advanced editing. This is the author's preferred way of working with assets. Extract the Image with Transparency \u2691 Open the unlocked PDF in Acrobat Pro Click Tools and Edit PDF Right-click the image Select Edit Using => Adobe Photoshop Click Yes on the warning window that appears The image with transparency is ready in Photoshop You can save the image as a PNG, and use it in your VTT of choice. Extracting an image with transparency using Adobe CC products Batch Extracting Images \u2691 Batch exporting images is often less useful, as the export will get all art assets (including decorative images, such as those in the margins of pages). However, it can be useful at times. Subscription: Adobe CC \u2691 Unlock the PDF (export the pdf to pdf in Preview.app (macOS) or File => Print => PDF in Foxit reader) Open the PDF in Acrobat Click Tools Click Export PDF Click Image Click your file type (note alpha will not preserved, no matter what) Click Export all images Click Export Choose the directory if needed Let the software run https://gfycat.com/victoriousoccasionalantarcticfurseal Free: I \u2665 PDF \u2691 Sites such as these are free to use, but their performance may not always be reliable. Unlock the PDF (export the pdf to pdf in Preview.app (macOS) or File => Print => PDF in Foxit reader) Go to ilovepdf.com Drag the PDF onto the page Click Extract Images Click Convert to JPG Click Download all JPG Images on the screen when ready Token Creation \u2691 There are several free websites you can use to create tokens; there is no best website. Find one you like. The Fateful Force Token Stamp 2 Token Tool 2 Google Slides (native with many Play-by-Post games) Free: Google Slides with Play-by-Post \u2691 If you have an image without transparency and are using Google Slides for your VTT, (for example, batch-extracted images with a white background), you can drag them onto Google slides and edit them to create tokens using the slides masking tool . Drag your image onto the slide Select the image by clicking on it Click the Mask button (it looks like a two right-angle lines intersecting to create a box) The image should now be highlighted, with the corners and edges covered with thick dark lines Drag the lines over the area you want removed from the token (you can also drag the image round behind the masking pane to adjust) Hit Enter. If you want a circular token, click on the Masks icon again and select Shapes => Circle You can add a border and numbers if you want Google Slides token creation \u2691 Free: Fateful Force \u2691 The Fateful Force VTT Token Maker is a simple-to-use token creator that has basic options as well as text. Drag your image onto the canvas Select your border Select your background (note, if your image doesn't have transparency this should match the background of your original art; often this is white [ #fff ]) Add text and scale the text if desired. Useful for multiple enemies of the same type. Download Fateful Force token creation \u2691 Square Tokens \u2691 To make a square token, just select None under \"Border Style.\" This will create a square token without a border for you. Subscription: Adobe Photoshop \u2691 Building a token in Photoshop allows you to customize in a variety of ways. You can find a font and style that you want. One of the benefits of Photoshop is automation. Building tokens is a repetitive task; the Photoshop Actions pane allows you to save your workflow for future use. Here is how to make a token in photoshop. You can use these steps for automation. Note that this is a destructive process, so if you want to save the art make a backup or do less automation by using tools like the Crop tool, but not checking Delete Cropped pixels. Add a new layer background: Layer => New Fill Layer => Solid Color => OK => enter fff in the highlighted text box => OK Drag the layer under the current layer Select the Rectangular Marquee tool Hold down Shift and drag out a square Select Image => Crop (note this is a destructive way of cropping; use the Crop tool if you want a destructive way of doing this, but note that it will be much harder to automate) Select the layers in the layers panel Hit Command + Option + Shift + E (mac) or Ctrl + Alt + Shift + E (Windows) to merge the selected layers Size the new image Select Image => Image Size Set the resolution to 72 (this is important for automation purposes! If your images are not all the same resolution your strokes and placement will be thrown off) Set the image size. 400 x 400 px is a good size Right click the top layer (the merged layer) and select Blending Options Click Stroke , select Inside , and set it to 12 px (or whatever you think looks good). You can change the stroke color to whatever you want, but I think black is simple and best. Number the token (optional) Select the text tool, and click inside the image. Enter a number. Size the text to so looks good, so you can see the number and the art Change the text color to white ( fff ) Right click the top layer and select Blending Options Click Stroke and this time select Outside instead of Inside, and it to 6 px (or whatever you think looks good) Now that you can see the number, adjust the placement, font size, and font to your liking. I like Taroca (free) because it matches the 2e rulebooks' heading text. Save the image. Double-click the number and add another number. Copy/Paste into Google Slides to Save Time You can select all and Copy Merged ( Edit => Copy merged ) and paste directly into Google Slides. There is no need to save your work onto the hard drive. This is a huge time saver for PbP GMs! Building a token by hand in Photoshop \u2691 Round Tokens \u2691 Add a new layer background: Layer => New Fill Layer => Solid Color => OK => enter fff in the highlighted text box => OK Drag the layer under the current layer Select the Elliptical Marquee tool Holding down Shift, drag a circle out over the area you want Select the layers in the layers panel Hit Command + Option + Shift + E (mac) or Ctrl + Alt + Shift + E (Windows) to merge the selected layers Hide the layers below this merged layer by clicking on the eye markers next to those layers Click Select => Select and Mask Scroll down and under Output To click on the dropdown and select New Layer Click OK Right click the layer and select Blending Options Click Stroke and add your stroke and color Click Trim => Transparent Pixels Save or copy to Google Slides This is also easy to automate (see below), but you need to start with your merged layer if the image has transparency. The author of this guide uses round tokens for PCs and square for NPCs, so it is not a use-case that comes up as often. Automation \u2691 The above work is not very feasible for a busy GM. However, automation is a powerful tool Photoshop users have at their disposal. Repeat the steps above while recording a new action, and you should be able to make this repetitive task a breeze. There are a couple \"gotchas\" to be aware of so your action works with any file: While recording, re-name your base layer to something that makes sense. The action's steps will break unless the layers being moved and merged have the same names every time. Size all images the to the same dimensions and resolution , and capture that in the action. I set all tokens to a 72 resolution, then I size the image to 400px wide. This keeps stroke and font placement consistent. Start your action after a selection is made. You cannot automate selecting the token area very well \u2014 that takes a human eye. An automated workflow \u2691 This workflow does all of the above (size, stroke, stroked numbering) with two clicks, from a selection of transparent artwork. Removing Backgrounds \u2691 Sometimes you may need to remove backgrounds from images in Photoshop. For example, you received flattened assets without transparency. or, perhaps you don't have access to Acrobat but you have access to Photoshop. Luckily, tools like the Magic Eraser make things go quickly. The Magic Eraser Tool \u2691 Removing background in Photoshop is quite easy using tools like the Magic Eraser. This is often the best choice for simple images, or images where speed is your primary goal. Hide the background layer by clicking the eye in the layers panel Click on the Magic Eraser tool Click on the background areas to remove it If too much of the image you want to keep is removed, adjust the Threshold (in the top left on your task bar); a Threshold of 15 is a good starting point. Your image now has transparency. Quickly removing the background in Photoshop \u2691 Masking Images \u2691 Sometimes a complicated image warrants a a little more effort. This is the case for images with complicated edges, such as creatures with hair or auras. This is when masking comes into play. I do not use this option unless two conditions are met: the creature is narratively important, and the artwork is complex. Click the Quick Selection tool Click the brush at the top to set a lower tolerance (usually something around 10 is good) Select the areas you want to keep Work to refine the edges. If you select too much, use the Option (macOS) key or Alt key (Windows) to deselect the range. Take as long as you like on refining the selection. This can take anywhere from a few seconds to many minutes, depending on how detailed you wish to be. Click the Mask button at the bottom of the Layers pane. Click Refine Play with the settings until you are happy with the image. I like to smooth and feather just a little bit, and check off Decontaminate Colors. Click OK. Masking an image in Photoshop \u2691 Maps \u2691 Maps can be extracted like images. When importing to a VTT like roll20, it is a good idea to first remove partial squares from the edges. This helps the map line up perfectly with the VTT's grid. You can use image editor like Photoshop to crop the image, or a free online editor such as I love Image to crop your asset. After it is cropped, simply count the height and width in squares, and create your canvas in that same size. Everything should line up perfectly. Maps on Google Slides \u2691 It is a best practice to use background images for Google Slides, so players can move tokens and create auras or notes without disrupting the gameplay board. Locked backgrounds are also an accessibility need for players with muscular disabilities. To avoid skewing, the image must be sized to fit. You can do this with image editing software like Photoshop, or online tools like croppola . Making 16:9 Maps in Photoshop \u2691 Start with your image open Select the Crop tool In the top right bar, to the right of Ratio enter 16, hit Tab and enter 9. This is your aspect ratio The 16:9 crop box should be viewable on the image Resize the image so it covers the area you want You can drag the image round to reposition it in the crop box Hit enter twice Save the cropped image In Google Slides, right click on your slide and select 1Change background.` Select Choose Image Upload your 16:9 image to slides Note that on Google Slides you can also create 4:4 slides. In that case, replace 16:9 with 4:3 in the instructions above.

This guide is meant to serve as a very brief overview to help players acclimate the the basics. System Requirements \u2691 Foundry is a modern application that runs in a browser window; as such, you should make sure that your machine can run it. Relatively modern computer running Windows 10, MacOS, or Linux operating systems with support for 64-bit architecture. An integrated GPU to enable hardware acceleration. 8GB of RAM A monitor no smaller than 1366x768. At this minimum resolution many aspects of the UI will feel cramped. A modern web browser like Chrome, Firefox, Opera, or Edge with hardware acceleration enabled. (Safari is not a supported browser at this time). \u2014 Source: Foundry Docs Logging In \u2691 Foundry can be run in a variety of configurations. Mine is on a self-hosted server that is almost always on. To join a game, navigate to the URL in your browser and select the user name the GM assigned to you. You probably do not need an access key (password). If you were assigned one, the GM should have told you and you would enter it here. Play Area Overview \u2691 Foundry operates within a canvas, or play area. There are three main areas you need to be concerned about as a player: the Canvas Layer Tools, the Sidebar and its Tabs, and the Macro and players area. The Foundry Canvas (Source: foundryvtt.com) Canvas Layer Tools \u2691 The toolbar on the left has two columns: the leftmost column is the tool, and the rightmost column are options within that tool. The top icon, the Token icon, is where you can select your token and move it, use Targeting, or to Measure Distance . The middle icon is the Spell Templates function. The Pencil icon is the Draw Shape function. Sidebar and tabs \u2691 The sidebar has several tabs. You can collapse the sidebar, then drag any table out into its own window. This is especially useful for combat. Bubble: The chat tab, where the dice rolling will happen. Fist: The combat tracker. Group of People: The Actors you can see in the game; your own PC and any minions are here, and can be edited when you click on them. The Briefcase: The game's items. The GM may put special items here and you can reference them. Open Book: Journal entries for the scene. You can even create your own. Tables: Randomized tables. You probably don't need to worry about this. Music: Music settings. I don't use music. Book: Compendiums. These are groups of items or actors that have been shared with you. They include spells, feats, actors, items, and macros. This is a great area to look up spells, conditions, etc. Gears: Player settings. You can change the UI skin, help solve frame rate issues, and other basic options. Arrow : Collapses Menu Interacting with the Canvas \u2691 Movement \u2691 You can drag your token anywhere you like. If you command-click on the token (control-click on windows), you can measure distance. If you click multiple times you can set waypoints. Press the space bar when you are ready to move, or right-click to reset. Highlight a Target \u2691 Click on the Target icon on the left. Click on the token you want to target. This will highlight it on the map for you. Alternatively, you can hover over the token you want to target and press \"T\" on your keyboard. Measure Distance \u2691 Click on the Ruler icon and drag out the distance. As with movement, you can command/control click to set up waypoints. Spell Templates \u2691 Select the right-angle ruler in the toolbar on the left, then select the type of spell. There is a circle for bursts, an angle for cones, a square for concurrent surface area, and an arrow for lines. Once you have the template dragged out, you can move it around. You can select the template to delete it when you're finished. Don't forget to delete the template when you're done, and that unless you select another tool Foundry will assume you want to add more templates. Journal Notes \u2691 If your GM has entered any journal notes for the area, you can click on this icon to highlight them. Double click on the journal icon to open it up. Creating A PC \u2691 This section covers how to create your token and character sheet. Actors \u2691 One of the fundamental objects within the Foundry Virtual Tabletop is the Actor . Actors are the protagonists, allies, monsters, antagonists, and persons within the World that you create. The game System being used has control to define the exact types of actors which are relevant for it\u2019s gameplay, but for most tabletop roleplaying systems these actors will represent the characters which the player Users impersonate and the foes they encounter. You have permission to create your own PC \u2014 an actor! Here's how to do that: Clicking on the icon in the sidebar that that looks like a group of people. At the bottom click Create Actor Name your PC Leave Character selected as its type Click Create Actor Creating your Token \u2691 After you create the Actor, you can double-click on it in the Actors sidebar to edit it and create a token. A Token represents the piece on the Game Board, and has several important settings. (If you just created a new actor, you will immediately be taken to the Character Sheet screen). To create a token for your PC, use the following steps: Click on Prototype Token in the character sheet (A \"prototype token\" is one that has not been placed on the board yet) Name the token however you want (this should already be correct) Select Hover on Display Name so others can see your token's name. Click on Image Select the image (follow steps outlined in Choosing an Existing Avatar Image using the file browser, or the steps in Uploading a new Avatar Image) Click on Vision If you have Darkvision enter its feet under Dim Vision If you normal have a light source in dark areas, enter its radius in the dim and bright fields under Emit Dim and Emit Bright . Both sources come from your token, so a Light spell that emits 20 feet of bright light and 20 feet of dim light should be set to 40 feet of dim and 20 feet of bright (which overlaps the dim). Click Update Token. Player Tokens Should Always be Round! Many GMs prefer to designate PCs and NPC tokens via shapes. This allows the user to quickly identify a fellow PC's token on the board, and an NPC's. In my games, NPCs should always be square, and PCs should always be round. Avatars \u2691 After logging in, you will be directed to choose your player avatar. The default is a mysterious, hooded person. I tend to make players trusted, so you can upload your own character avatar. Not all GMs will do this, and you may have to talk to them about getting your avatar set up. The default Avatar, a mysterious figure indeed! Uploading a new Avatar Image \u2691 To upload a new avatar, do the following: Click on the avatar image Click on \"User Data\" at the top of the image browser (this should be the default) Click on \"dragupload\" Click \"Choose File\" Click \"Select File\" Choosing an Existing Avatar Image \u2691 I have a library of images from previous games, and they are ready to share with you! If you played with me before, it's likely I moved your uploaded tokens to the correct folder as well. Click on the avatar image Click on the Up arrow until you see Assets Click on Assets Click on PC Art (or whatver directory your gm has the artwork in) Select your token (note that there are a variety of view options next to Display Mode so you can see previews of the image) Click Select File Changing your Actor's Avatar \u2691 Your character can have different art from its token. This art will also show up in the \"Actors\" pane and on the sheet. This is true for any Actor, in fact. To add or change an actor's avatar, use the following steps: Open the character sheet Click on the big avatar image Select the image or upload an image (follow steps outlined in Choosing an Existing Avatar Image using the file browser, or the steps in Uploading a new Avatar Image ) Adding your Character Token to the Map \u2691 You can now drag your token onto the map, and it will have the correct settings. If the GM has the map set with darkness (such as nighttime or in a cavern) you will only see a black screen and a warning. Just drag your token onto the map if the GM hasn't done so for you. If you want to change these settings on the token for just one map, double-click on the token and adjust the vision under the \"token\" window. If you want to update the token's settings so you can use it again later, update the prototype token under the Actors pane so it's always set correctly. The examples here are for Pathfinder 2e, but 1e will have a similar process. Editing Your Character Sheet \u2691 You can edit your character. This can be exported later on to port between Foundry games. However, for my games I do not require a complete character sheet \u2014 we use the honor system here. However, there are some useful things you can add. Hit Points \u2691 You can edit hit points to track them in combat. To do so: Open character sheet Add your Level Add your Constitution Add your Ancestry HP Add your Class HP Add your bonus HP and Bonus HP/level (Toughness, etc) Add your Current HP (match the Total HP) You should see a full health bar under your token Adjusting Hit Points \u2691 You can adjust the hit points in a variety of ways. Right click on the token Enter the damage or a negative integer under the health bar to take damage. Add a \"+\" sign to get healed Hit enter The health bar will be updated. This can give players a visual clue about your health without metagaming too much Initiative Modifier \u2691 I like to roll initiatives with a macro that rolls for everyone and sots it \u2014 this means it's helpful to add your initiative mod to your sheet. Select the ability used under Initiative Fill out that part of the sheet Select Proficiency if Perception (left click to increase, right to decrease) Add any bonuses from feats, etc (for example, Battlefield Surveyor for fighter) Close Sheet Perception for Initiative Other Skill for Initiative Rolling Dice \u2691 To roll dice go to the chat log. It's the bubble on the rightmost side. Then, type your command prefixed by \"/roll\": / roll 1 d20 + 14 + 2 You can do very simple macros that combine attack and damage. Here is an example of a character with a striking flail with crit specialization, and sneak attack: I attack with my flail to hit AC [[ 1 d20 + 14 ]] for [[ 2 d8 + 4 ]] slashing damage and [[ 2 d6 ]] sneak if flat - footed and prone if crit You could integrate deadly, fatal, and anything else you like here. Macros \u2691 Macros are useful tools. The above attack and damage example is an example of a macro. You can edit your own macros on the hotbar. You can also add them from compendiums that you have access to (note that some compendium macros may require you to have your character sheet fully set up). The main goal here is to get you started with fast, simple macros and not to do anything overly complex. Macros are very powerful, and get complex fast! Building a Macro \u2691 Click on the hotbar . If there's already a macro there, right-click to edit or remove. Name the Macro Enter the macro type ( chat is the default and works fins for simple macros; script is a javascript macro) Select the macro image (there are images available in the default library) Enter the Macro Text Click Execute Macro to test Click Save Macro if it works You can use the macro by tapping the number on your keypad or clicking it Using a Compendium Macro \u2691 Click on the Compendium area on the right sidebar Scroll down the the Macros section Click on the category. A new window will open. Click on the macro you want to use in order to preview it Drag the macro you want to your hotbar Right-click and edit the macro to your liking, or click on it to execute it The GM may make a variety of compendiums available. I have a default set of simple attack/damage with multiple attack penalties, saves, and perception.","title":"Foundry Basics"},{"location":"foundry-basics/#foundry-basics","text":"It is worth noting that Foundry has deep documentation, built by their community, on their website .

You can bring your character to a public game anywhere in the world. Why Organized Play? \u2691 Organized Play is a great way for busy adults to get gaming sessions in; often, we cannot find time to commit to a weekly group with friends. Organized Play lets you bring your character to thousands of public events anywhere in the world. Benefits Consistency : Adventures are designed and run and with consistency in mind Convenience : Busy players can pick up and play whenever their schedule permits, anywhere in the world Variety : Players can build a large number of characters Community standards : Organized play adheres to community standards designed to create mutually respectful play experiences Social : Players make new friends by sharing a hobby Drawbacks More paperwork : As a global campaign, players need good accounting methods and are tracked and sometimes audited The \"railroad\" : Adventures are pre-written to fit into a time slot, so players don't have time for lengthy story diversions Not a customized campaign : The GM cannot facilitate long-term character arcs Older website : The Paizo website is required to use, but can be tricky to navigate For many players, Organized play games scratch a different itch than a home campaign with friends, and they play both. Getting Started \u2691 This is an independent guide and not affiliated with Paizo. To get started, check out the official Organized Play Foundation website: New Player Welcome Getting Started in Pathfinder Society Getting Started in Starfinder Society Important Links \u2691 New and returning players may need quick access to important game information: Register Pathfinder 2e FaQ & Errata Starfinder FaQ & Errata 2e Character Options Starfinder Character Options 2e Boon Text (under the heading Achievement Points and Boons Join Organized Play \u2691 Create an account \u2691 All Organized Play members must have a Paizo account. Here's how to set that up: Navigate to the sign in page Fill out your date of birth Click Continue Fill out the fields, including an active email address you can check (required) Click Create New Account Log into your email Click the link to verify your new account Enter a public username for your account Enter a password and re-rype it Select your preferences regarding private messages and transactional emails Agree to the privacy policy by making sure the box is checked Click Confirm Join Organized Play \u2691 There are two paths to joining organized play: Getting a number by attending a game or convention, or registering one for yourself. A New Player Organized Play Card given to a player; note the Organized Play ID and Confirmtaion Code. To activate your ID, or get a new one, follow these steps: Sign in to the Paizo site Go to your Account by clicking My Account in the site navigation Sign in again if asked to Click on Join Organized play Account Settings with the `Join Organized Play` button circled. Next, you are taken to a window with two options. The leftmost option is for the users who received a Organized Play number already (such as at a convention). If you received such a card, fill out this form. The rightmost option is for those who do not have a registration number. If you have an Organized Play number and a PIN, you need to use the leftmost button. If you don't have one, use the rightmost button. If you select the left option, the organized play ID will become associated with your account. If you select the rightmost option, your character will be assigned the next available ID. Components of your ID \u2691 Your ID consists of two parts: your Organized Play Number, and a number determined by the system. Starfinder characters start with -701 and count up from there; Pathfinder 2e characters start with -2001 and count up from there. So, your first registered character's ID should look something like 123456-2001 . Never Lose your ID Never lose your org play ID. It is difficult (if not impossible) to recover. If you receive a card at a convention, it is a good idea to take a picture of it as a backup.

What are Chronicles & Boons? \u2691 A Chronicle is a catch-all term for an official record in organized Play. it is like a receipt that tracks your earned XP, gold, and even access to certain special character options. A Boon is a receipt that grants a rward of some kind to the player or PC. Chronicle vs Boon : You may hear the terms used interchangeably. Generally, this isn't a big deal. You can see how the post adventure chronicle is laid out at the official Guide . No matter how you store your paperwork, you should kleep good records in a format you can show to other players. Here is an example of a character's digital records. Note that the character has several kinds of boons, and uses a spreadsheet to track his inventory. The player could bring this character to any game, and show this paperwork to a GM who wished to audit the character. Achievement Points \u2691 By running or playing lots of games, you earn a currency called \"Achievement Points.\" You can cash these in n the Paizo site to buy \"Boons\" \u2014 special pieces of paperwork that grant you official access to rare character options. it can be difficult finding where and how to spend this currency, though.

Many players enjoy it as a supplement to their other gaming\u2026 some even consider it the highest form of tabletop gaming! Benefits Allows for deep roleplay, since players can take their time crafting each post An excellent venue for creative players who do not excel at improv Allows for asynchronous play Drawbacks Can be too slow-paced for some (tables vary) Paizo uses BBCode, a deprecated and clunky syntax The Paizo forums were not designed for Play-by-Post, so players sometimes need to leverage hacks and workarounds Avatar art selection is difficult and limited Many players enjoy both play by post and live gaming. As with every other medium, nothing here is exclusive. Creating a Play by Post Alias \u2691 First, register a character. This time, you should select a character image. You can go back and change it later on. Go to Character Image and click Change . There are hundreds of avatars to sort through; try to find one that matches your character's personality. Hover over the one you want and click Select this Avatar. Selecting an avatar. Hover over your selected image and click `Select this Avatar.` Last, click Submit Changes. You should now have an alias that you can select anywhere on the forums. Below every text box is a Post As dropdown, and you can select any aliases there. A post on the new forum alias. Alias vs Character Profile \u2691 This is a common point of confusion on the Paizo website. An alias is not the same thing as a character profile. Let's look at the character we just created by navigating to Organized Play : There are two links circled. The Character's name goes to edit the Profile, and the Edit button takes you to the Alias. As you can see, there are seemingly two ways to edit the character. Which one is which? If you click on the Character Name , you are taken to edit the profile. This profile is what other users see when you post using that alias on the forums, and it is the location where you will be adding character sheet information. If you click on the Edit button, you will be take n to the Alias. You need to edit the Alias to change your character's avatar. Everything else can be edited on the profile. Editing the Character Profile Editing the Character Alias The profile has character information, but does not contain the avatar image. The alias doesn't have your character info for games, but it contains your character's image. Adding Information to your Character \u2691 Play by post typically uses your Paizo character's profile for their character sheet, so filling it out is important. Tp do this, navigate to your character's profile: Hover over My Account and click Organized play Locate the character under My Characters Click the character's name (not the Edit button) Click Edit my Profile You should now be on a page that contains a bunch of text fields that you can fill out. First, enter the character's full name in the Full name field. Adding the Slashline \u2691 Next, you want to start filling out your character's slashline. The slashline contains important at-a-glance information that your fellow players and GM will find useful, such as hitpoints, armor, status, and spells. Since the Paizo boards don't have an official slashline, players use the Race and Class/Levels text areas to input this data. With limited character space, it is often written in shorthand (e.g. \"AC\" for \"Armor Class,\" \"HP\" for \"Hit Points,\" etc). If you aren't sure, feel free to ask! Here are copy-paste-able templates for Pathfinder Second Edition slashlines, just replace the relevant areas: Slashline Template for Race Field GENDER CLASS LEVEL | [ b ] Perc [ / b ] + X ( SENSES ) | Speed : X ' | [b]HP:[/b] X/Y | [b]AC:[/b] X (NOTES) | [b]Fort:[/b] +X [b]Ref:[/b] +X [b]Will:[/b] +X (NOTES) Slashline Template for Gender Field | Spells : Foc : X / Y ; 1 : X / Y | Exploration : ACTIVITY | Status : CURRENT_STATUS | Hero Points : X When you are done, your profile should have all that information where it says \"Full Name\" and \"Race\" \u2014 it probably looks like a mess, but don't worry. When you actually post it will be formatted better. A basic slashline as it appears in a PbP game. Adding the Character's Stats \u2691 When you edit your character's profile, you have many other options to fill in. This is all optional, but most GMs want you to provide a character sheet they can read. In the About section, you can provide a description of your PC, as well as their character sheet information. There are several templates out there to fill in if you like, or if you are using a service like Hero Lab it can output a stat block for you. Here is how I format my stat blocks; as above, you can copy and paste to use as a starting point. One particular feature of this template is that is uses Paizo forum syntax to create macros for many of the character's abilities, while still being readable.

Forum Syntax \u2691 The forums use opening and closing tags for basic formatting and dice rolling: Bold Text [ b ] This is bold text [ / b ] Italic Text [ i ] This is italic text [ / i ] Small Text [ smaller ] This is smaller text [ / smaller ] Large Text [ bigger ] This is bold text [ / bigger ] Strikethrough Text [ s ] This is strikethrough text [ / s ] Out-of-Character text [ ooc ] This is out of character text [ / ooc ] Spoilers [ dice = Spoiler_Title ] Spoiled text goes here . [ / dice ] Dice Expressions [ dice = Description_of_Roll ] dX + Y [ / dice ] You can combine all tags. Combining Tags [ b ][ i ][ s ] This is bold italic strikethrough text [ / s ][ / i ][ / b ] Always Close Tags Make sure to close tags; there is a forum bug where if you leave a [b] tag open, it makes the entire game bold \u2014 and it cannot be undone! The only recourse is to start a whole new game thread. Posting Conventions \u2691 Every player and gm has slightly different preferences. However, there are a few best practices. Narrative Text \u2691 When speaking, make it bold and surround it in quotes [b]\"Hello my name is Beef McLarge Huge the fighter\"[/b] said the large huge fighter. When posting internal monologue, use italics [I]\"I really wish I was taller\"[/i] said the fighter. Be descriptive! The main draw of play by post is the opportunity to use evocative language, and really immerse yourself in the setting. When Speaking out of character, flag it as such Clarity is important, but so is flavor and narrative! You can use OOC text to highlight game mechanics while keeping things flavorful in \"normal\" text: Brock Enrol sings an arcane word and then flicks a dollop of butter at the aberration. [ooc]Grease (V, M); DC 16 Reflex save[/ooc]. This is both flavorful from a story perspective, and clear from a mechanical perspective. Provide hooks and push Interact with other PCs while pushing forward with the story. [b]\"Brock, I'm pushing the door open. Get ready in 3\u2026 2\u2026\"[/b] Formatting Dice Rolls \u2691 Dice rolls should be informative and concise. A good standard is to place the attack name, and any modifiers that effect the roll in the description. For example, here are tow attacks being modified by Inspire Courage and Frightened 2: [dice=Club, Cold Iron, Strike 1, Inspire Courage, Frightened 2]1d20 + 4 + 1 -2[/dice] [dice=Bludgeoning, Inspire Courage]1d6 + 4 + 1[/dice] [dice=Club, Cold Iron, Strike 2, Inspire Courage, Frightened 2]1d20 + 4 + 1 -2 -5[/dice] [dice=Bludgeoning, Inspire Courage]1d6 + 4 + 1[/dice] This player wrote Inspire Courage in both their attack and damage roll descriptions. They also included Inspire Courage's +1 bonus, and Frightened 2's -2 penalty, separately, which added extra clarity. In the second Strike's attack roll, they also included the -5 for the Multiple Attack Penalty. This is excellent! Every bonus and penalty to the d20 roll is clear, and the GM can understand how each total was achieved. Note that the player also included the damage type in the damage roll. Including the damage type is important, as enemies often resist or are weak to certain kinds of damage. Reactions and Out-of-Turn Actions \u2691 Reactions, AOOs, and other out-of-turn activities can be tricky in play-by-post. Pre-roll reactions where applicable so the game keeps moving, and designate their trigger, on your turn. (It might help you to make a macro for this, or save text that you can copy/paste somewhere.) For example, a fighter anticipating getting an attack of opportunity on \"Bee Evil\" might write: If Bee Evil moves through a square I threaten: [spoiler=AOO] [dice=Club, Strike 1]1d20 + 2[/dice] [dice=Bludgeoning, Strike 1]1d6 + 2 + 1[/dice] [/spoiler] It is considered good form to place reactions in spoilers to keep the post efficient. At times, you may not want to other players to see your reaction\u2026 in which case the spoiler (and honor system) is a good plan. If you have multiple reactions, note your preference on which one you will take and what the triggers are. For example: Brock has his shield raised and if Bee Evil hits him and does over 15 damage, he will use the block reaction. However, if Mook walks through a threatened square after Big Bad goes, he'll take an AOO: [spoiler=AOO] [dice=Club, Strike 1]1d20 + 2[/dice] [dice=Bludgeoning, Strike 1]1d6 + 2 + 1[/dice] [/spoiler] GMs will generally work with the player to help keep the game flowing smoothly (for example, a defensive-oriented Champion might ask the GM to assume she shield blocks, and automatically reduce the damage for her and note her shield damage). Teamwork is the secret sauce to keeping things flowing and building a repertoire! Rolling Saves \u2691 When asked to roll a save, you should always make it the first dice roll on your next post (or if necessary, rolled in the narrative order of operations). If you do not follow this rule, many GMs will instead roll for you. Use the Discussion Thread \u2691 Most games have a Gameplay thread, and a Discussions thread. The majority of GMs prefer to keep a narrative flowing in the Gameplay thread. It is considered polite to post your questions (or have a discussion) in the Discussions thread instead of gameplay. At times, there may be involved discussions about the rules, and this can derail a game when the back-and-forth appears in the middle of the narrative. Dotting In \u2691 Often you will be asked before the game starts to \u201cdot in.\" This means you post something in the campaign thread, then delete it. This links your character to the gameplay thread so the GM and others can see it in the \"Players\" section of the campaign, and places it in your Campaigns page. After you post something like \"dot!\" in the gameplay thread, go ahead and delete the post to ensure the gameplay thread stays narrative-focused. Round Tokens \u2691 Most play by post GMs use Google Slides. A standard style is to use square tokens for enemies and round tokens for PCs. To make a round token in Slides: Drag your artwork onto the slide Select the image Select the Image Mask option Select the circle shape icon Add a border to the now-masked image Video Example Save Your Hard Work \u2691 It's often a good idea to write your posts in a text editor, or copy and them before hitting Submit. Sometimes, the Paizo forums glitch out, and there is nothing worse than losing a beautiful, long post! Finding games \u2691 The Paizo forums are always recruiting games under the auspices of Organized play! Pathfinder 1e: the Flaxseed Lodge Pathfinder 2e: the Cottonseed Lodge Starfinder: Castamir's Flaxseed Station Read the GM's Profile \u2691 Every gm has different conventions and needs. When you join a game, click on the GM's profile and read anything they've written. Make sure they seem like a good fit for you and that you can make any accommodations they ask for (for example, some GMs are colorblind and prefer dice split across separate lines). One of the most important considerations is how often the GM expects you to post. Do not sign up for a game if the Gm expects you to post daily, and you cannot commit to that. Find a game that fits your desired pace. Follow Instructions \u2691 GMs will need you to sign in if it's for an Organized Play game. They often use slides to to determine marching order, character info, secret checks, and the like. Try to be timely about getting them all the info they need, and don't be shy about asking for help. Campaigns Tab \u2691 When you find a game to join, the GM will provide you with a forum link. You can \"dot in\" on the gameplay thread so it shows up on your campaigns tab. Any game you've played in will show up there, too. To get to your campaigns tab: Sign in Click on My Profile Click on Campaigns Here, you should see all the campaigns associated with all of your characters. You can click on any campaign to go to the game.

A good standard is to place the attack name, and any modifiers that effect the roll in the description.

They also included Inspire Courage's +1 bonus, and Frightened 2's -2 penalty, separately, which added extra clarity. In the second Strike's attack roll, they also included the -5 for the Multiple Attack Penalty. This is excellent! Every bonus and penalty to the d20 roll is clear, and the GM can understand how each total was achieved. Note that the player also included the damage type in the damage roll. Including the damage type is important, as enemies often resist or are weak to certain kinds of damage.","title":"Formatting Dice Rolls"},{"location":"play-by-post/#reactions-and-out-of-turn-actions","text":"Reactions, AOOs, and other out-of-turn activities can be tricky in play-by-post. Pre-roll reactions where applicable so the game keeps moving, and designate their trigger, on your turn. (It might help you to make a macro for this, or save text that you can copy/paste somewhere.) For example, a fighter anticipating getting an attack of opportunity on \"Bee Evil\" might write: If Bee Evil moves through a square I threaten: [spoiler=AOO] [dice=Club, Strike 1]1d20 + 2[/dice] [dice=Bludgeoning, Strike 1]1d6 + 2 + 1[/dice] [/spoiler] It is considered good form to place reactions in spoilers to keep the post efficient. At times, you may not want to other players to see your reaction\u2026 in which case the spoiler (and honor system) is a good plan. If you have multiple reactions, note your preference on which one you will take and what the triggers are. For example: Brock has his shield raised and if Bee Evil hits him and does over 15 damage, he will use the block reaction. However, if Mook walks through a threatened square after Big Bad goes, he'll take an AOO: [spoiler=AOO] [dice=Club, Strike 1]1d20 + 2[/dice] [dice=Bludgeoning, Strike 1]1d6 + 2 + 1[/dice] [/spoiler] GMs will generally work with the player to help keep the game flowing smoothly (for example, a defensive-oriented Champion might ask the GM to assume she shield blocks, and automatically reduce the damage for her and note her shield damage).

Back in the days of true pen and paper gaming, the GM could simply print a copy of the chronicle for each player and fill it out at the table. This model no longer works in many cases, as online gaming and paperless accounting have become more prevalent. However, Paizo's scenarios are copyright protected, so you can't easily edit them! While services like RPG Chronicles can build your chronicles for you, they cost money. Making Chronicles with Free Software \u2691 This guide will use Preview, the default PDF reader for maxOS, but it will work for Foxit Reader on Windows as well as many other readers of choice (including expensive ones like Acrobat Pro). Whatever software you prefer the method is the same: you need to extract a single page from the PDF and edit it. To achieve this, you will use the Print to PDF feature that ships with common software or is built into your OS. Extract the Page \u2691 Click File => Print Name the file, and save it in a directory that you can find It's a good idea to create a directory for your chronicles, as you will be creating up to 7 of these things! Print to PDF as it appears on macOS. On Foxit it likely appears on the \"Printer\" dropdown. Create the Base Chronicle \u2691 Locate the typewriter or text annotation tool On Preview, this is un Tools => Annotate => Text on Foxit there is a Typewriter button on the top toolbar Fill in the information that will go on all chronicles. Event Name Date Org Play # Your name in lieu if Signature Bonus Faction Reputation earned (generally, players earn the same reputation unless one is going slow) Fill in dummy text or all the customized areas Player Name Character name Org Play ID Character # GP XP Checkboxes Click Save Copy the file as many times as you need Repeated Content Placeholder Content Fill out all the repeated content you can to avoid re-work Use placeholder content so you can quickly edit later. Create the Chronicles \u2691 Name each file so you know what character each chronicle they belong to On macOS you can select the item then press Return On Windows you can select the file and press F2 Edit the dummy test as appropriate Save Always Save Your Work Players often find mistakes on their chronicles, forget to sign in as slow track, etc. If possible, always back up your chronicle sheet work to avoid having to do re-work! A chronicle directory on a computer; note the file names are clear and understandable. Share the Chronicles \u2691 Share the chronicles in whatever way is easiest for you. Some GMs prefer uploading them to a Google Drive folder; others prefer sending them out manually via email. Whatever is easiest for you is best\u2026 it's a lot of work! Making Chronicles with RPG Chronicles \u2691 RPG Chronicles lets you sign up for free and generate chronicles; you need to own the PDF and upload a special code that's on the chronicle sheet. See the how it works guide on RPG Chronicles. Finding the Code Make sure to close tags; there is a forum bug where if you leave a [b] tag open, it makes the entire game bold \u2014 and it cannot be undone! The only recourse is to start a whole new game thread. Location of the Chronicle Code on the chronicle (the code is blurred out here); look on the bottom of the chronicle to find the code. Sending the information to the reporter \u2691 If you're not reporting, make sure to Make sure to send the information to the designated reporter for the event. There is a Save Reporting Information button on the Chronicles and Reporting page that will copy all the info to your clipboard. A note on Accessibility \u2691 The author tested the chronicles with text annotation on Preview.app as well as RPG Chronicles. MacOS VoiceOver picked up all the added text in both instances. However, the items on the PDF came through in the incorrect order. This seems to be an issue with the PDF structure and/or tags. There is not much a GM can do about it. As always, try to do your best and keep in mind text annotation is better than a hand-written chronicle when dealing with digital assets. Final Thoughts \u2691 There is often a tradeoff between convenience and ease of use; those who GM often may find services such as RPG Chronicles convenient. VOs who report many games may even find the paid version of RPG Chronicles convenient, as it offers a Google Chrome extension that does one-click reporting for you.

The term \"Virtual Tabletop\" is often abbreviated as \"VTT.\" This guide will provide an overview of the most popular VTTs, as well as general considerations. Which VTT is Best for Us? \u2691 Note the question isn't \"Which VTT is right for me \u2014 it's us. Choosing a VTT should be a group endeavor whenever possible, as it will impact everyone's enjoyment of the game. For online gamers, the VTT choice can an output of Session 0 . Campaigns where the VTT is chosen ahead of time (often due to GM preference) should put that up-front in their recruiting literature, letting players decide. An example of this are one-off Pathfinder or Starfinder scenarios that are open to the public for signup; and players are free to attend a different game if they cannot use the GM's platform of choice. Google Slides \u2691 A Google Slides map. Note the initiative tracker template added by hand by the GM. Google slides can be used as a bare-bones VTT. Essentially, the GM creates a set of slides with backgrounds set to the map, and allows anyone to edit it/ Players create tokens for their PCs and move them around on the map, rolling dice at their table. Cost \u2691 Google Slides is free to use; the GM should own a Google Account to edit the slides. In addition, the group needs to set up some kind of voice or VTT, so a Discord server may need to be acquired. Pros, Cons, Audience \u2691 Google Slides can be a fast way to get a VTT off the ground, and it's used by the play-by-post.md community, but it lacks almost al the features modern players tend to expect when it comes to a VTT. Though free, users need to have some kind of voice setup such as a discord server. Finally, users with muscular or vision disabilities may have difficulty interacting with the slides. Pros Quickly set up tables No experience needed to use Very old-school/minimalist feeling Free Works on all browsers and devices Cons Editing is a slower process than other VTTs Lack of features such as initiative trackers can slow down games Players and GMs need to trust one another as dice are rolled off-screen Poor support for users with disabilities (can be mitigated by GM, but it takes extra work such as fitting backgrounds to slides) Who Will Love It Who Will Hate It Users who also play on play-by-post Users who want simple technology Users who want old-school games Users looking to occasionally supplement their in-person gaming with a \"minimum viable product\" Users who want full-featured VTTs Users who are bad at doing math with physical dice GMs who don't trust their players (and vice versa) Roll20 \u2691 Combat in Roll20. Roll20 is the most popular VTT; it offers standard tools and is free. However, many users have moved away from Roll20 because of its bugs and slower development cycles. In addition, the Roll20 subscription model is essentially required in many cases \u2014 especially for GMs who wish to use their API. That said, Roll20 is still the most popular option out there as it's free to start playing and packed with features that are now expected in many VTTs. Cost \u2691 Roll20 has a tiered subscription model. While it tours a free-to-play system, active GMs will run out of space quickly. For Organized Play, access to the Character Vault for portability between games helps many players (but is not required). Feature Free Plus Pro Asset Space 100 MB 3 GB 6 GB Ad-Free Dynamic Lighting Custom Character Sheets API Access Dev Server Character Vault YEARLY COST $0 $50 $100 Pros, Cons, Audience \u2691 Roll20's entry floor lower than other VTTs, but so is the ceiling. It's a great fit for GMs who want a basic VTT, have a budget, and do not want to tinker with port forwarding, automation, or server creation. Pros Core is stable and works well, even on lower-end computers Users don't need to be tech-savvy Community made sheets for many games Reasonable subscription price Partnerships with Paizo to put adventures on marketplace More accessible for disabled users than most other VTTs Most portability of standard VTTs qith the character vault (subscription required) It can be challenging for users intimidated by technology or on a limited setup. Cons Slow development cycle for new features and requests Features often don't work as intended, such as uploading and asset management API only avialable from the top-tier subscription Subscription model makes exporting your own content difficult Lighting effects and animations are not optimized from a code perspective Content is not free (and rather expensive), compared to Foundry where it's mostly free so long as you own the PDF Who Will Love It Who Will Hate It GMs who want a VTT that offers the basics, with a lower learning curve Players who want complex macros and dice syntax Users who do not have nice computers Users using screen readers (paired with GMs putting in the extra work to format text correctly) People with a budget to buy first-party material on the marketplace Users playing indie RPGs Users who want something simple Users who demand an attentive development cycle Users who want easy-to-set-up animations and dynamic lighting Users who want a sleek UI Foundry \u2691 The Foundry UI. Foundry is a standalone, self-hosted application that uses modern web technologies and has a large community of developers. Cost \u2691 The Foundry license is a $50 one-time license for the GM; they can then invite players to their server. While Foundry is touted as a low-cost solution, keep in mind there may be other costs on top of this. A self-hosted Foundry setup requires the host to let others directly connect to their computer while the game is running, which can expose the user to security risks as well as technical challenges. It is a good idea to purchase strong antivirus software, a new and up-to-date modem, etc. Several options exist to host for free (Oracle Always Free, AWS Free Tier), or for comparable pricing of Partner Hosted (Digital Ocean droplets start at $5 which meet the minimum requirement, but the recommended specs require a $10 droplet), or any similar service. Feature Self-Hosted Partner Hosted Cloud Hosted Software License $50.00 $50.00 $50.00 Monthly Hosting $4-12 $0-20 Game Access While GM is running app Cost Variable At all times Setup Difficulty Med Low High Security Risk Med Low Low 1st YEAR COST $50 $98-194 $50-290 Pros, Cons, Audience \u2691 Foundry is a great fit for a group of people who are versed in tech and have decent desktop computers. Pros One-time software license for GM only Powerful and customizable Rich plugin ecosystem Walls/lighting are super fast and intuitive to set up More intuitive UX than most other VTTs Free content for PDF owners: all rulebooks and APs/Modules ready-to-run Players who want complex macros and dice syntax Constant updates from an active developer community It can be challenging for users intimidated by technology or on a limited setup. Cons Requires a fast computer with a large screen; the system requirements are more aligned with a computer game than a VTT Only works on Chrome, Firefox, Opera, or Edge with hardware acceleration enabled Technical / DevOps skills are required for setup and maintenance, or a monthly subscription with variable rates that can get expensive Accessibility is lacking for screen readers and colorblind players Lack of native portability for PCs makes running games in Organized Play difficult Constant updates mean the GM needs to keep their server and plugins maintained and can sometimes cause issues Who Will Love It Who Will Hate It GMs who are interested in web/server technology A group of people with gaming computers Users who want to tinker with tons of options and features GMs who want to quickly import official content, for free Users who want something simple GMs who aren't comfortable with web technology GMs who don't want to tinker or futz with the details Users who do not have nice computers Users with disabilities Fantasy Grounds \u2691 The Fantasy Grounds UI. (source: Rise of the Runelords Anniversary Edition product page) Fantasy Grounds is almost 20 years old, and has a loyal following. It offers extensive automation, but is also rather expensive. Cost \u2691 Fantasy Grounds is feature-rich, and users pay for that. unlike other VTTs, Fantasy Grounds is set up in such a way that all users need to have a subscription or license to participate. The GM can, however, purchase Fantasy Grounds Unlimited and let players play for free (they still need Fantasy Grounds accounts and demo licenses of the software). Feature Standard Subscription Unlimited Subscription Standard License (one time) Unlimited License (one time) Players Play Free (with Demo) YEARLY COST $48 / Person $120 $39 / Person $149 Pros, Cons, Audience \u2691 Fantasy Grounds is an excellent choice for players who enjoy automation and enjoy the old-school UI. Pros Tons of features Automation galore Native 3-D Dice One-time purchase option Developers are actively fixing bugs and adding features Established and active community Offers official adventures for Pathfinder Cons More expensive than other options, and players need to have a demo or license Dated UI with lots of popup windows Automation can get in the way of homebrew Fewer character sheets than other systems Who Will Love It Who Will Hate It GMs who want lots of automation for crunchy games like Pathfinder Users who want to own the software and the games Users who are invested in taking their time to really master a powerful system Users who want something simple Users on small screens Users constrained by cost Users playing indie RPGs Google Slides \u2691 A Google Slides map.

Creating an Event \u2691 To create an event, click on Submit an Event. Then, name the event. Tip Keep in mind that the event name will also be a hotlink on the Warhorn site to your event\u2019s page, so make sure to name it something easily identifiable. For example, a lodge at the Ellsworth station in Antarctica might be named \u201cEllsworth Antarctica Organized Play.\u201d Next, set the event as a one-time event or recurring event. By default, the This is a one-time event box is checked and requires a date or date range to be entered. If your event is to be recurring, uncheck the one-time event box. No dates will be required for entry at this time (this will be handled later). Nest, provide an event location (blended online and in-person event setup is possible with the software and is set up during the scheduling of a session). If it is to be held online, put a check in the This event is held online box. If the event is to be an in-person event, leave the This event is held online box unchecked. If the event is to be a blend of in-person and online, it is your choice how to handle the This event is held online box, but best practice would be to make sure to add to the details of the event that it will be both. If the event is to be private, check the This event is private box. nest, place any additional comments in the comments box. It may be considered best practice to make sure to include any rules your lodge has for signing up or any other rules that players should know before they decide to join. Finally, select either Submit your event with a donation or Submit your event for free . Event Dashboard \u2691 Wait for Warhorn staff to email you to tell you your event site is live. This will give you access to the event dashboard. When you have access, you should be able to see new dropdowns on the top right of the screen: Tools icon : Here you can manage the schedule, scenarios, registrations, venues, fees, and archive or delete your event. List icon : Here you can manage the event's setup, including the Title, Contact, Dates, Location, Details, Fee Settings, Roles, Options, and Integrations. Make any alterations needed to finish setting up the event by first clicking the Setup dropdown button at the top right of the screen. These might include: Title (if changes are needed) Your contact information Dates (again, this will only be required for a one-time event) Location Details (This is where you can get specific about the event, and should contain enough information for players to know how your event will work.) Fee Settings (If your event requires any participation fees, whether a badge fee, a table fee, charitable donation fee, or any other fee, players and GMs alike should be made aware in advance.) Set up Roles \u2691 Each role has predefined permissions that you can customize. They include managing the event, managing the session, and viewing [player information. Default roles are: Attendee GM Staff You can assign additional roles as you see fit. it is considered a best practice to not allow players to see one another's personal information such as email or discord usernames. Tip Some hybrid events create custom roles like \"In-Person Player\" and \"Online Player\" to differentiate players who play at the local game store versus those who play online; another example might be a local and non-local player. Roles are a great way to customize your events. Opening the Event \u2691 When the event is ready, put a check in the box labeled Attendees can register for this event. Optionally, you can also have a custom registration message sent to anyone when they register for the event. A custom message can be a good way to welcome players. The Discord connection is set to Ignore by default, meaning attendees are not required to have their Discord account connected to their Warhorn account, however, it is highly suggested that for online events this be changed to Required if your lodge uses Discord for voice chat. Signup options \u2691 There are several options available to organizers. You can automatically clear registrants to participate (leaving this box unchecked makes it require a manual review and approval) You can enable a GM Signup List Additionally, as with Roles, you can permit the GM to manage the details of their sessions and/or allow GMs to see participation contact info by checking the appropriate boxes here, which will then be used as the default permissions for every GM sign up. Enable waitlisting can be used for two primary reasons: to let players sign up in case of someone backing out, and to gauge player interest. If the waitlist size warrants it, it would be advisable to attempt to find additional GM(s), if the desire is there to play at the specifically set date and time Alternatively, if there is no desire by all players to play at the scheduled date and time, it could be used to set up an additional session at another time. Waitlists are ordered automatically (first in, first out) by Warhorn, and cannot be altered by event staff. In the event, a new session is added and it will pull players from the waitlist, which will be automated based on signup order. Enable monthly calendar view \u2691 Enabling the monthly calendar view will allow users to look at your scheduled sessions by either an Agenda view or a Calendar view, permitting them to jump to specific dates. Services \u2691 This specific setting is only useful if you have a Facebook page, which then adds a Facebook Like button or box to your event page. Manage the Event \u2691 The button immediately to the left of the Setup button is the Manage button. This button allows you to make changes to the schedule, scenarios, registrations, venues, and registration fees (each has its listing on the dropdown menu). Note: - For ongoing games, such as Organized Play games, the two that will be used most frequently will be Schedule and Scenarios . Manage Schedule \u2691 To add your first session, click on the Add The Next Occurrence button. In the new window, set the start date, start time, time zone, and session duration, and hit save. Once the occurrence is added, click the Add Another Slot button if you plan to have multiple sessions, and repeat the above steps. Click on the time slot that is now under the date of your occurrence On this new screen, click on Add A Session In the new window, select the scenario you are planning to run for this slot (I would advise following the steps in the Manage Scenarios area before the Manage Schedule area, as the official scenarios that can be chosen in this section need to be added before scheduling them to link directly to the scenario description and information on Paizo\u2019s website) by beginning to type it in. (Starfinder\u2019s prefix is SFS. Pathfinder prefixes are PF1 and PF2, respectively.) Select or verify the language the game will be run in Set the number of tables and number of players per table (keeping in mind that the maximum number of OP players, by rule, is 6) Add any specific notes for the session and scenario Make sure there is a check next to Active before saving, or your new session will not show on the agenda or calendar views of your event. Click on the Scenario name link that will have now been created to manage the session further. For Online Games : If possible indicate which VTT is in use as well as where the Discord server information and invitations will be placed for online games. You can also set up session specific-permissions for each role vs. the global permissions previously mentioned. Click on Add Virtual Tabletop and select the appropriate choice from the list. Note: There is an Other choice, in the event the one you use is not listed. Input the appropriate server information or link for web apps to share with players. Note: - For Fantasy Grounds Unity, you will also need to choose if this is a Cloud or a LAN game and provide the GM Name and the table password, if there is one. Provide the name of the VTT (Mine is named \u201cStarfinder Society Organized Play\u201d, and users will search for me either by my GM name, the VTT name, or both) Add any notes and hit save Add Voice/Chat Services, if you are using any Select the appropriate service from the dropdown menu Provide the Server Invite Link (for Discord, you will also need to provide the names of the text and voice channels, as well as any invitation links for the specific channels). Add the Server Name, any notes you feel applicable, and hit save. For In-Person events, it will work similarly, choosing the venues previously added instead of choosing a VTT and Voice service. It is possible to use this feature to set up a singular event for a lodge, adding all VOs as Staff to then give them access to schedule their sessions instead of each need to set up their event. Boston PFS is already doing this. Manage Scenarios \u2691 Before you can schedule games, you must first add scenarios. This is achieved in the manage Scenarios area. Add Global Scenarios \u2691 This option has access to Paizo\u2019s database of scenarios to choose from to add to your event. Pathfinder is broken out into PF1 and PF2 as the prefixes, and either AP or Mod to select adventure paths or scenarios. Starfinder\u2019s prefix is SF and is broken out as AP, Mod (currently only used for the Free RPG Day Skitter Adventures), or SFS #-##, with the numbers indicating the season and scenario number. To add a scenario, start typing the system's prefix, followed by the scenario number or type. You can also type in the scenario name, and it should pick it up. You will need to do this every time Paizo comes out with new scenarios, or you want to run something your event hasn't run before. Add Custom Scenarios \u2691 Provide the scenario name Leave checked or remove the check (as required) from the box indicating if this is an Organized Play Campaign Scenario. Type in a few characters for the game system Optional fields can be used to include the following: Author Min Level Max Level Number of players per table Scenario blurb Cover art image URL External URL Custom Copy Manage Registrations \u2691 In this section, you can clear people to sign up for sessions (if you do not have automatic clearing turned on), unclear them (if need be), or add registrations. This section also shows you if any of the users have not paid their fee (if there is one). Note A note on adding registrations - if the user you are attempting to add to your event already has an account on Warhorn, this will not work, as using this action creates a new Warhorn account for the user credentials you are submitting. By clicking on an existing registered user\u2019s name on the list, you will be able to go into their registration and add them to roles other than the default Attendee role. Manage Venues \u2691 Here, you can add in-person venues, public or private, for inclusion in your event. You will need the following information to add a venue: Venue name Address City Country State Zip Code Phone Number Be sure to review the Visibility area of the venue entry, as it defaults to the public, permitting anyone on the site to see the address and phone number of the venue, which you may not want if you\u2019re also using this for your home game and put in your personal information for the venue information. Registration Fees \u2691 To add a Base fee: Set a name for the fee Set the fee amount Default fee, Public fee, and Active fee. If there's one public active base fee, it will be automatically selected at registration time. If there is more than one public active base fee, the registrant will be required to select one of them, and the one chosen as default will be preselected. To add an Extra fee or Discount: Set a name for the fee Set the fee amount Public fee, and Active Fee (there is help text on the site about these, though some of it is not very clear, aside from that leaving the box checked for Public Fee makes it open for everyone on the site to see, and the others may only truly apply if you have a fee structure or discounted fees based on volunteering or early sign-ups). Note An Extra fee or Discount will only show up if at least one public active extra fee/discount is configured. Each of these is an optional selection for the registrant.","title":"Warhorn for Organizers"},{"location":"warhorn-for-organizers/#warhorn-for-organizers","text":"","title":"Warhorn for Organizers"},{"location":"warhorn-for-organizers/#creating-an-event","text":"To create an event, click on Submit an Event.

If the waitlist size warrants it, it would be advisable to attempt to find additional GM(s), if the desire is there to play at the specifically set date and time Alternatively, if there is no desire by all players to play at the scheduled date and time, it could be used to set up an additional session at another time.
