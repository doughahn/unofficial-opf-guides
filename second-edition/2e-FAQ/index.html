<p>This means you need to use your healer's tools for Battle Medicine, but you can draw and replace worn tools as part of the action due to the errata on wearing tools on page 287. </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Update</em>: We will be updating the tools revamp to indicate that worn healer's tools (along with other tool kits) take only one hand to use, as you don't have to hold the whole kit in your other hand, just pull out the things you need. What this means for Battle Medicine is that you only need one free hand to perform it with worn healer's tools, you don't need both hands.  </li>

<p>"You can jump a distance greater than your Speed by spending additional actions when you Long Jump or High Jump. For each additional action spent, add your Speed to the limit on how far you can Leap." </p>

<p>As an example, supposing you had a Speed of 40 feet and 25 on your Athletics check, Cloud Jump triples the 25 feet to 75 feet, but the limit of 40 feet still applies so you would jump 40 feet. If you spent another action, the limit based on your Speed would raise from 40 feet to 80 feet, so you would jump 75 feet.</p>

<h4 id="page-271-carrying-gear">Page 271: Carrying Gear<a class="headerlink" href="#page-271-carrying-gear" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h4>
<p>We've simplified the way we're handling characters carrying their gear so that you can define all your carried items in one of three categories. Replace the "carrying and using items" section with this text: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A character carries items in three ways: held, worn, and stowed. Held items are in your hands; a character typically has two hands, allowing them to hold an item in each hand or a single two-handed item using both hands. Worn items are tucked into pockets, belt pouches, bandoliers, weapon sheaths, and so forth, and they can be retrieved and returned relatively quickly. Stowed items are in a backpack or a similar container, and they are more difficult to access. Drawing a worn item or changing how you’re carrying an item usually requires you to use an Interact action (though to drop an item, you use the Release action instead). Table 6–2:  Changing Equipment on page 273 lists some ways that you might change the items you’re holding or carrying, and the number of hands you need to do so. Many ways of using items require you to spend multiple actions. For example, drinking a potion worn at your belt requires using an Interact action to draw it and then using a second action to drink it as described in its Activate entry (page 532)." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This change also removes several sorts of "container" items from the tables on 286-292, as they are no longer tracked separately from the items they store. These are: </p>
<ul>
<li>bandolier</li>
<li>belt pouch</li>

Fine clothing reduces that limit to light Bulk worth of tools.""</p>

<p>Attack Rolls. There was some confusion as to whether skill checks with the attack trait (such as Grapple or Trip) are also attack rolls at the same time. They are not. To make this clear,  add this sentence to the beginning of the definition of attack roll </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When you use a Strike action or make a spell attack, you attempt a check called an attack roll." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>To clarify the different rules elements involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <strong>attack</strong> is any check that has the <strong>attack trait</strong>. It applies and increases the multiple attack penalty.</li>
<li>An <strong>attack roll</strong> is one of the core types of checks in the game (along with saving throws, skill checks, and Perception checks). They are used for Strikes and spell attacks, and traditionally target Armor Class.</li>
<li>Some skill actions have the <strong>attack trait</strong>, specifically Athletics actions such as Grapple and Trip. You still make a skill check with these skills, not an attack roll.</li>
<li>The <strong>multiple attack penalty</strong> applies on those skill actions as well. As it says later on in the definition of attack roll "Striking multiple times in a turn has diminishing returns. The multiple attack penalty (detailed on page 446) applies to each attack after the first, whether those attacks are Strikes, special attacks like the Grapple action of the Athletics skill, or spell attack rolls." There is inaccurate language in the Multiple Attack Penalty section implying it applies only to attack rolls that will be receiving errata.</li>

<p><strong>Minions</strong> are creatures that directly serve another creature. A creature with this trait can use only 2 actions per turn, doesn’t have reactions, and can’t act when it’s not your turn. Your minion acts on your turn in combat, once per turn, when you spend an action to issue it commands. For an animal companion, you Command an Animal; for a minion that’s a spell or magic item effect, like a summoned minion, you Sustain a Spell or Sustain an Activation; if not otherwise specified, you issue a verbal command as a single action with the auditory and concentrate traits. If given no commands, minions use no actions except to defend themselves or to escape obvious harm. If left unattended for long enough, typically 1 minute, mindless minions usually don’t act, animals follow their instincts, and sapient minions act how they please. A minion can’t control other creatures. </p>
<p>A creature called by a spell or effect gains the summoned trait. A summoned creature can’t summon other creatures, create things of value, or cast spells that require a cost. It has the minion trait. If it tries to Cast a Spell of equal or higher level than the spell that summoned it, it overpowers the summoning magic, causing its own spell to fail and the summon spell to end. Otherwise, the summoned creature uses the standard abilities for a creature of its kind. It generally attacks your enemies to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with it, you can attempt to command it, but the GM determines the degree to which it follows your commands.</p>
<p>Immediately when you finish Casting the Spell, the summoned creature uses its 2 actions for that turn. A spawn or other creature generated from a summoned creature returns to its unaltered state (usually a corpse in the case of spawn) once the summoned creature is gone. If it’s unclear what this state would be, the GM decides. Summoned creatures can be banished by various spells and effects. They are automatically banished if reduced to 0 Hit Points or if the spell that called them ends. </p>

<p>In the last errata document, we removed some of the restrictions on spells like magic weapon requiring you cast them on a nonmagical weapon, but we missed a few.

<p>While there are numerous places in the Core Rulebook that indicate that non-Strike attack actions like Shove and Trip take a multiple attack penalty on their checks, in one spot in the definition of multiple attack penalty, it mentions that you take your multiple attack penalty on attack rolls.

<p>We're making a significant change to how ancestry ability boosts work. The purpose of this is to better reflect diversity within each ancestry and to allow for greater freedom in creating characters. Though you can still choose the ability boosts listed in each ancestry, every character has a new alternative option.</p>
<h4 id="alternative-ability-boosts">Alternative Ability Boosts<a class="headerlink" href="#alternative-ability-boosts" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h4>
<p>The ability boosts and flaws listed in each ancestry represent general trends or help guide players to create the kinds of characters from that ancestry most likely to pursue the life of an adventurer. However, ancestries aren’t a monolith. You always have the option to replace your ancestry’s listed ability boosts and ability flaws entirely and instead select two free ability boosts when creating your character.</p>
<p>The text above is an alternative open to all characters, not an optional rule. Voluntary flaws remains an optional rule. Due to many of its advantages being supplanted by the rule above, we've made some adjustments to voluntary flaws to make them purely a roleplaying choice.</p>
<h4 id="optional-voluntary-flaws">Optional: Voluntary Flaws<a class="headerlink" href="#optional-voluntary-flaws" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h4>
<p>Sometimes, it’s fun to play a character with a major flaw regardless of your ancestry. You can elect to take additional ability flaws when applying the ability boosts and ability flaws from your ancestry. This is purely for roleplaying a highly flawed character, and you should consult with the rest of your group if you plan to do this! You can’t apply more than one flaw to any single ability score.</p>

<p>Multiple rules that should work with both plants and fungi currently work with only plants, and these changes make them work the way they’re intended. Note that this isn’t a universal change! Some rules, like plant form, plant growth, and blight, still apply only to plants. The following rules should work with both plants and fungi.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sylvan (Page 65)</strong>: The Sylvan language in the table should list plant and fungus creatures.</li>
<li><strong>Leaf Order (Page 131)</strong>: The anathema apply to fungi.</li>
<li><strong>Leshy Familiar (Page 133)</strong>: Your familiar is a fungus if you choose a fungus leshy.</li>
<li><strong>Woodland Stride (Page 135)</strong>: You get the same benefits moving through fungi.</li>
<li><strong>Green Empathy (Page 136)</strong>: You can communicate with fungi in the same way as with plants.</li>
<li><strong>Entangle (Page 336)</strong>: The area is “all squares in a 20-foot burst that contain plants or fungi”.</li>
<li><strong>Nature’s Enmity (Page 354)</strong>: Fungi hate them too!</li>
<li><strong>Speak with Plants (Page 370)</strong>: You can speak with fungi in the same way as plants.</li>
<li><strong>Commune with Nature (Page 410)</strong>: They know about fungi too.</li>

<h3 id="page-72-quick-alchemy">Page 72 Quick Alchemy<a class="headerlink" href="#page-72-quick-alchemy" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h3>

<blockquote>
<p>“You create a single alchemical consumable item…” </p>

<p>instead of </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You create a single alchemical item…” </p>

<p>This wording is more precise, and works correctly with non-consumable alchemical items.</p>
<h3 id="page-7376">Page 73–76<a class="headerlink" href="#page-7376" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h3>
<p>The alchemist is getting multiple changes to allow for more choice and allow options from books outside the Core Rulebook. These boost all the fields in the books somewhat, with some additional spice for the chirurgeon.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Research Field (page 73)</strong>: The chirurgeon can now choose two common 1st-level elixirs with the healing trait to add to their formula book. In addition, they can substitute Crafting for Medicine in a broader scope, as follows.<blockquote>
<p>"You can use your proficiency rank in Crafting for anything that requires a proficiency rank in Medicine (such as prerequisites), and use your Crafting modifier in place of your Medicine modifier for all Medicine checks."</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><strong>Field Discovery (page 74)</strong>: The chirurgeon gets the three-elixir benefit to make any elixir with the healing trait, not just elixirs of life.</li>
<li><strong>Perpetual Infusions (page 75)</strong>: All of these have changed somewhat to offer a broader selection. In addition, due to changes to perpetual potency and perpetual perfection, there's a new sentence here: "Each time you gain a level, you can swap any number of your perpetual infusions with other eligible infusions." <ul>
<li><strong>"Bomber</strong>: Choose two 1st-level bombs.</li>
<li><strong>"Chirurgeon</strong>: Choose two 1st-level elixirs with the healing trait. If a creature heals Hit Points from a perpetual infusion, that creature is temporarily immune to healing Hit Points from subsequent perpetual infusions for 10 minutes (but not immune to any other effects of those infusions).</li>
<li><strong>"Mutagenist</strong>: Choose two 1st-level mutagens."</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The chirurgeon required a special rule for elixirs that heal HP to work correctly alongside healing resources across the game. Giving everyone in your party a perpetual infusion elixir of life when you stop for a rest will still work, but you don't get much benefit from doling out 300 of them in that 10 minutes. Note that can still choose to spend reagents when creating an elixir to heal a creature that has temporary immunity to perpetual infusions! </p>
<p>Note that, unlike the toxicologist in Advanced Player's Guide, these don't restrict you to only common items, since those restrictions are already a part of adding formulas to your formula book. If you've gained access to an non-common alchemical item that fits the other restrictions, you can choose it for a perpetual infusion. We will consider changing the toxicologist when we next set our gaze on that book.</p>
<p>Since this is likely to become a FAQ given some of the perpetual infusions changes, remember that perpetual infusions remove only the reagent cost for Quick Alchemy. You would still need to spend extra batches of infused reagents to Combine Elixirs with a perpetual infusion, for example.</p>
<p><strong>Perpetual Potency (page 75)</strong></p>
<p>The choices you can make are more broad, and you no longer need to upgrade your choices from perpetual infusions (hence the ability to swap out your perpetual infusions when you level up, so you can upgrade your favorite item if you like). The levels are different between research fields to maintain the intended balance while still allowing the options from previous printings of the Core Rulebook.</p>
<ul>
<li>**"Bomber: Choose two 3rd-level or lower bombs.</li>
<li><strong>"Chirurgeon</strong>: Choose two 6th level or lower elixirs with the healing trait.</li>
<li><strong>"Mutagenist</strong>: Choose two 3rd level or lower mutagens."</li>
<li><strong>Perpetual Perfection (page 76)</strong>: These changes are similar to perpetual potency's, but did not require the - **same level restrictions.<ul>
<li><strong>"Bomber</strong>: Choose two 11th-level or lower bombs.</li>
<li><strong>"Chirurgeon</strong>: Choose two 11th-level or lower elixirs with the healing trait.</li>
<li><strong>"Mutagenist</strong>: Choose two 11th-level or lower mutagens."</li>

<blockquote>
<p>“You gain the ability to Cast a Spell and use any spellcasting actions necessary to cast your innate spells; since this magic is innate, you can replace any material component with a somatic component (page 303).

<p>The 3rd printing errata to alter reality, miracle, primal phenomenon, and wish inadvertently restricted spells you could choose from other spell lists too much.

<p>The text on Gaining and Losing actions on page 462 and for the last step of starting your turn on page 469 indicated that if you had a condition that said “you can’t act,” you wouldn’t regain any actions on your turn, rather than merely being unable to use them. This conflicted with the sidebar on page 622, which was correct. Conditions and other effects that cause you to change the number of actions you regain (such as quickened, slowed, or stunned) say so.</p>
<p>The text under Death on page 460 has been amended slightly to say you lose all your actions while dead so it works as intended.</p>

<p>Can I use Shield Block if I take physical damage that didn't come from an attack?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shield Block can only be used against physical damage from attacks, since non-attack effects can't trigger the Shield Block. For instance, if you walk over a square of hazardous terrain that deals piercing damage to you, having your shield raised doesn't help you, nor does it help if you need to make a Reflex save against a spell that deals bludgeoning damage. Some abilities let you use Shield Block with other triggers, as seen in the shield spell and the fighter's Reflexive Shield feat, but these exceptions are noted. Also note the 4th printing errata to spellguard shield (page 588) allows it to apply in this way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I hold a weapon that requires 1 hand in 2 hands, is it a 2-handed weapon?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>There are two answers to this.</strong></p>
<p>For abilities that count the number of hands for a weapon while you're using it, such as an action with "Requirements You are wielding a one-handed melee weapon," count the actual number of hands you're using at the time. If you're holding a bastard sword in two hands, you couldn't use it with that ability. Weapons with the "1+" notation in their description, such as most bows, use both your hands when shooting, but leave you with a hand free for other actions the rest of the time.</p>
<p>Anything that's an intrinsic part of the weapon, such as a shifting rune, works differently. Reference the weapon's "Hands" entry in the weapons table—a bastard sword requires 1 hand, even though it gets a benefit in two hands from the two-hand trait. If you were holding a shifting bastard sword in two hands and activated it, you could turn it into a longsword (which you'd still be holding in two hands), but couldn't turn it into a greatsword (which requires 2 hands). For this purpose, "1" and "1+" are the same (though this doesn't matter for shifting since "1+" appears ranged weapons).</p>

<p>What do I need to do to switch how many hands I'm using for a jousting weapon?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to use a jousting weapon one-handed while on a mount, you can make this decision as part of taking your Mount action. After that, changing hands takes the same actions described on page 271 under Carrying and Using Items. If you dismount while wielding a jousting weapon one-handed, you can either switch to using two hands as part of that action if you have a hand free at that point. If not, you'll still be holding the weapon in one hand, but not able to wield it. You'll have to free up a hand and Interact to wield the jousting weapon while not mounted.</p>

<p>Can a minion be quickened or slowed? </p>

<p>Yes. This can be a bit unclear because those conditions apply “at the start of your turn” and a minion can’t typically act until you use an action. Apply these conditions and any other effects that alter a minion’s number of actions when the minion gains its actions, using 2 actions and 0 reactions as the minion’s starting number. Though a minion can’t normally act when it’s not your turn, abilities that specifically grant a minion a reaction provide an exception to this (such as the Ferocious Beasts orc ancestry feat, Advanced Players Guide page 19).</p>

<p>Immunity to critical hits reads “When a creature immune to critical hits is critically hit by a Strike or other attack that deals damage, it takes normal damage instead of double damage.” This means what it says: The attack deals normal damage instead of double damage. Other effects specific to a critical hit still occur, such as critical specialization effects and extra damage dice from traits like deadly and fatal. You also still have the option to use abilities that trigger on critical hits, like the vorpal rune’s reaction (though many creatures immune to crits also don’t need heads to live, lucky devils). Your GM can still say no to extremely strange consequences of this rule on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>If an affliction makes me enfeebled 1 without listing a duration and the affliction ends, am I enfeebled forever? </p>

<p>The rules on Conditions from Afflictions note that a condition can last for a longer duration that the affliction that caused it, using drained as an example. There are three categories of effects from afflictions here.</p>
<ol>
<li>Immediate effects like damage happen as soon as you reach the stage.</li>
<li>Conditions that have a way to end them by default last for their normal duration. This includes conditions like drained, frightened, persistent damage, and sickened.</li>
<li>Conditions that always need to include a duration because they don’t have a normal way to recover from them—such as clumsy or paralyzed—last as long as the stage of the affliction on which they appear. This also applies to effects that are ongoing but specific to the affliction rather than being defined conditions, such as a penalty to certain rolls.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>How do I adjudicate forced movement if a creature makes another creature move with it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Creatures like elephants and rocs can move while taking a grabbed creature with them. The rules on page 475 say “Usually the creature or effect forcing the movement chooses the path the victim takes. If you’re pushed or pulled, you can usually be moved through hazardous terrain, pushed off a ledge, or the like. Abilities that reposition you in some other way can’t put you in such dangerous places unless they specify otherwise. In all cases, the GM makes the final call if there’s doubt on where forced movement can move a creature.”</p>
<p>So can you summon an elephant and have it run alongside a wall of fire and drag a creature in its trunk through every square of the wall? Generally, no. The point is that the victim is being carried with the creature. However, the GM can make other calls within reason calls here. For instance, if the elephant moves through that wall of fire, it’s likely it and the creature both take the damage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What can a shifting rune change a weapon into?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This repeats some information from the clarification on one-handed versus two-handed weapons. </p>
<p>Because a shifting rune is based on the attributes of the weapon it's etched to, reference the weapon's "Hands" entry in the weapons table to see what it can turn into. A bastard sword requires 1 hand, even though it gets a benefit in two hand from the two-hand trait. If you were holding a shifting bastard sword in two hands and activated it, you could turn it into a longsword (which you'd still be holding in two hands), but couldn't turn it into a greatsword (which requires 2 hands).</p>
<p>So what if the weapon has the jousting trait, normally requiring two hands, but you're wielding it in one hand because you're on a mount? You can activate shifting to turn it into a different weapon that requires 2 hands and has the jousting trait and continue as you are, or you can turn it into a weapon that requires 2 hands and doesn't have the jousting trait. If you do that, you're still holding it in one hand, but can't wield it unless you free up another hand and Interact to change how you're holding it.
One further note: The shifting rune can change the Bulk of the weapon, but you can't, for example, turn an adamantine shifting weapon of light Bulk into a weapon of 1 Bulk and sell the adamantine. You would use the base form, not the form magic has turned it into.</p>

<p>Classes like the magus and summoner lose their lower-level slots as they go up in level, but can still cast lower-level spells from staves. In other words, a spellcaster who has 2nd- and 3rd-level slots but not 1st-level slots can still cast a 1st-level spell from a staff. (A magus who prepares a staff still has to sacrifice a spell slot they actually have if they want to add extra charges, though.)</p>

<p>Multiple Persistent Damage Conditions notes that you keep only the highest amount of persistent damage.

In these cases, the GM should quickly use their best guess to decide which applies. Don’t worry about doing all the math of average damage, just follow your heart to which seems most severe.</p>

    Range 120 feet; Area 20-foot burst  <br />
    Saving Throw basic Reflex; Duration sustained up to 1 minute  <br />
    You create a gray storm cloud that pelts creatures with an icy deluge. When you Cast the Spell, a burst of magical hail deals 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 2d8 cold damage to each creature in the area below the cloud (basic Reflex save). Snow and sleet continue to rain down in the area for the remainder of the spell’s duration, making the area difficult terrain. Any creature that ends its turn in the storm takes 2 cold damage. If you Cast this Spell outdoors, you can create two non-overlapping clouds instead of one. As normal, if a big creature is in both clouds, it still only takes the initial damage once and the continuing damage once per turn.  <br />
<strong>Heightened</strong> (+2) The initial bludgeoning damage and cold damage increase by 1d8 each, and the cold damage creatures take at the end of their turns increases by 1.    </p>

    Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal  <br />
    Range 120 feet; Area 20-foot burst  <br />
    Saving Throw basic Reflex; Duration sustained up to 1 minute  <br />
    You create a black, rumbling storm cloud and call down one lightning bolt within the spell’s area. The bolt is a vertical line from the top of the storm cloud to the ground below, dealing 4d12 electricity damage to creatures in the line (basic Reflex save). On subsequent rounds, the first time you Sustain the Spell each round, you can call another lightning bolt within the area. If you Cast this Spell outdoors, you can create two non-overlapping clouds instead of one, though you can still call down only one bolt per turn.   <br />
    Heightened (+2) The damage of each bolt increases by 1d12.    </p>

<p>The Magic Warrior archetype should be uncommon, just like the other archetypes in the book. Add the uncommon trait to the Magic Warrior Dedication feat.</p>
<h3 id="page-95-nameless-anonymity">Page 95: Nameless Anonymity<a class="headerlink" href="#page-95-nameless-anonymity" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h3>
<p>The Nameless Anonymity feat is missing a tradition for its nondetection spell. After the final sentence, add </p>

<h3 id="page-117-megafauna-animal-companion">Page 117: megafauna animal companion<a class="headerlink" href="#page-117-megafauna-animal-companion" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h3>
<p>The exact nature of a megafauna animal companion is unclear. Any animal companion can be a megafauna animal companion, which changes how the animal companion can progress at a later time, allowing the animal companion to become a savage or indomitable animal companion instead. The GM has ultimate say on which animal companions can be megafauna animal companions, though most animal companions based on animals and beasts can be megafauna. Before the first sentence of the Megafauna Minions sidebar, add </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When you pick your animal companion, you can choose to have it be a megafauna animal companion."</p>

<p><em>What actions qualify for the requirements of the resonant weapon trait's Conduct Energy action?</em></p>
<p>You can only use Conduct Energy with actions that have one of the required energy traits. Using an action other than a spell that causes damage with the listed trait does not necessarily qualify unless the action also has the trait.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, if you used the ifrit's Scorching Disarm action, you could channel fire energy into your weapon via Conduct Energy, as Scorching Disarm itself has the fire trait.</li>
<li>However, if you made a Strike with a flaming weapon, the Strike action does not have the fire trait, so you couldn't use Conduct Energy. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="page-79-beastkins-shape">Page 79: Beastkin's shape<a class="headerlink" href="#page-79-beastkins-shape" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h3>
<p>It was unclear which of the beastkin's shape was the natural shape for the purposes of Change Shape. Before the last sentence of the beastkin's heritage entry, add: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A beastkin’s hybrid form is their natural shape."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="page-81-animal-shape">Page 81: Animal Shape<a class="headerlink" href="#page-81-animal-shape" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h3>
<p>The beastkin's Animal Shape feat was missing options for beastkin with insects as their inherent animal. Make the following changes to the Animal Shape feat:</p>
<p>Change the third sentence to read</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When you gain this feat, choose either aerial form, animal form, dinosaur form, or insect form; after you choose a form, you can’t change the form."</p>

<p>Change the fifth sentence to read, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If your inherent animal isn’t among the animals listed in the form, you default to the statistics and abilities of the bird battle form, cat battle form, deinonychus battle form, or ant battle form for aerial form, animal form, dinosaur form, and insect form, respectively (at the GM’s discretion, you instead default to a different form that is closest to your inherent animal)."</p>

<h3 id="page-89-fleshwarp-statistics">Page 89: fleshwarp statistics<a class="headerlink" href="#page-89-fleshwarp-statistics" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h3>
<p>The fleshwarp statistics did not fully line up with the flavor presented in the fleshwarp entry. Change the Size entry from "Medium" to "Medium or Small" to allow for Small fleshwarps, which might have originated from existing Small ancestries.</p>

<p>Rungus are real-world weapons and their original description ignored their cultural significance. We updated the description to better reflect the weapon's real-world origins and give it a better sense of place in the setting. Change the second sentence of the rungu's description to </p>
<blockquote>

<p>The oscillating wave psychic’s unique psi cantrips (thermal stasis, entropic wheel, and redistribute potential) are not intended to interact with their conservation of energy class feature, as they manipulate cold and fire at the same time. Similarly, psi cantrips from other conscious minds (for instance, ones gained through the Parallel Breakthrough feat) shouldn’t interact with conservation of energy. Modify the text in the Conservation of Energy section from </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The first time in an encounter that you cast a granted spell from your conscious mind or a psi cantrip” </p>

<p>The feats granting spellcasting benefits in the psychic multiclass archetype have some unintended discrepancies from corresponding feats in other multiclass archetypes. </p>
<ul>
<li>First, Master Psychic Spellcasting should be an 18th-level feat, rather than a 12th-level feat. </li>
<li>Second, Expert Psychic Spellcasting should have a Prerequisite listing of “Basic Psychic Spellcasting, master in Occultism” and Master Psychic Spellcasting should have a Prerequisite listing of “Expert Psychic Spellcasting, legendary in Occultism.”</li>
