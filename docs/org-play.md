# Organized Play 101

###### `Authored by Doug Hahn`

Organized play is like pickup basketball, but for tabletop gaming. You can bring your character to a public game anywhere in the world. 

## Why Organized Play?

Organized Play is a great way for busy adults to get gaming sessions in; often, we cannot find time to commit to a weekly group with friends. Organized Play lets you bring your character to thousands of public events anywhere in the world. 

**Benefits**

- *Consistency*: Adventures are designed and run and with consistency in mind
- *Convenience*: Busy players can pick up and play whenever their schedule permits, anywhere in the world
- *Variety*: Players can build a large number of characters
- *Community Standards*: Organized play adheres to community standards designed to create mutually respectful play experiences
- *Social*: Players make new friends by sharing a hobby

**Drawbacks**

- *More Paperwork*: As a global campaign, players need to good accounting methods and are tracked with player IDs
- *The "Railroad"*: Adventures are pre-written to fit into a time slot, so players don't have time for lengthy story diversions
- *Not a Private Campaign*: The GM cannot help you customize long-term character arcs
- *Older Website*: The Paizo website can be tricky to navigate

For many players, Organized play games scratch a different itch than a home campaign with friends, and they play both.

To activate your ID, or get a new one, follow these steps: 

1. [Sign in to the Paizo site](https://paizo.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Store.woa/wa/DirectAction/signIn?path=paizo)
1. Go to your Account by clicking `My Account` in the site navigation
1. Sign in again if asked to
1. Click on `Join Organized play`

<figure markdown>

<figcaption>Account Settings with the `Join Organized Play` button circled.</figcaption>
</figure>

Next, you are taken to a window with two options. The leftmost option is for the users who received a Organized Play number already (such as at a convention). If you received such a card, fill out this form. The rightmost option is for those who do not have a registration number.

<figcaption>If you have an Organized Play number and a PIN, you need to use the leftmost button. If you don't have one, use the rightmost button.</figcaption>
</figure>


If you select the left option, the organized play ID will become associated with your account. If you select the rightmost option, your character will be assigned the next available ID. 

#### Components of your ID
Your ID consists of two parts: your Organized Play Number, and a number determined by the system. Starfinder characters start with `-701` and count up from there; Pathfinder 2e characters start with `-2001` and count up from there. So, your first registered character's ID should look something like `123456-2001`.

!!! warning "Never Lose your ID"

    Never lose your org play ID. It is difficult (if not impossible) to recover. If you receive a card at a convention, it is a good idea to take a picture of it as a backup. 

## Creating a Character

1. Log in at [https://paizo.com/organizedPlay/myAccount](https://paizo.com/organizedPlay/myAccount) (or create an account)
1. Click on `Create a Character`
1. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click `Register a New [Game System] Character`
1. Enter the character's name. You may need to add a number after it so it's unique — that's ok, this is just part of the character's unique record for accounting purposes on the Paizo website, it doesn;t have to be the character's official name in games
1. Select a faction (optional)
1. Ignore the rest, no one uses it
1. Click `Submit Changes`

## Paperwork

The core tracking mechanisms of Organized play are twofold: games reported to the Paizo website by the person who organized the event, and the chronicles and boons you receive as a player.

### What are Chronicles & Boons?
---
A `Chronicle` is a catch-all term for an official record in organized Play. it is like a receipt that tracks your earned XP, gold, and even access to certain special character options. 

A `Boon` is a receipt that grants a rward of some kind to the player or PC. 

*Chronicle vs Boon*: You may hear the terms used interchangeably. Generally, this isn't a big deal. 

You can see how the post adventure chronicle is laid out [at the official Guide](https://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/pfs2guide._.Full-Guide#Filling_Out_a_Chronicle).

No matter how you store your paperwork, you should kleep good records in a format you can show to other players. [Here is an example of a character's digital records.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SJCwmegf0it28Dk53L-MXRZxtNmo1Go2?usp=sharing) Note that the character has several kinds of boons, and uses a spreadsheet to track his inventory. The player could bring this character to any game, and show this paperwork to a GM who wished to audit the character. 

## Achievement Points

By running or playing lots of games, you earn a currency called "Achievement Points." You can cash these in n the Paizo site to buy "Boons" — special pieces of paperwork that grant you official access to rare character options. it can be difficult finding where and how to spend this currency, though.

## Fame and Chronicle Rewards

Like Achievement Points, there are other kinds of rewards that are earned from playing or running games. If you choose to represent a faction in your game system of choice you automatically earn a special currency called "Fame" with them.

You can also get access to special items or character options by having a chronicle sheet that grants you access to the item.
