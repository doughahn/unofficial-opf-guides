# 2E FaQ/Errata

## Pathfinder Core Rulebook Errata Part 1

###  Updated Terminology

Several ability names changed slightly between the Pathfinder Playtest and the final Pathfinder Core Rulebook, and while we tried to catch them all, we missed a few. Make the changes as noted below.


### Page 57: Adaptive Adept
**Adaptive Adept**: Change “Adapted Spell” to “Adapted Cantrip”

### Page 62: Field medic background 
**Field medic background**: Change “Battle Medic” to “Battle Medicine”

### Page 75: Perpetual Infusions
**Perpetual infusions (bomber option)**: Change “lesser liquid ice” to “lesser frost vial”

### Page 91 Thrash
**Thrash**: Change “ferocious specialization” to “weapon specialization”

### Page 115: Instrument of Zeal
**Instrument of Zeal**: Change “Smite Evil” to “Blade of Justice”

### Page 139: Primal Wellspring
**Primal Wellspring**: Change “Wild Focus” to “Primal Focus”

### Page 156: Mystic Strikes
**Mystic strikes class feature**: Change “handwraps of mighty fists” to “handwraps of mighty blows”

### Page 168: class features
**Class features**: Change “weapon expertise (ranger only)” to “ranger weapon expertise”

### Page 198 (undead bloodline“touch of undeath), Page 405: 
Change “touch of undeath (sorcerer)” to “undeath’s blessing”

### Page 206 sidebar, Page 349: magic aura
**Magic aura**: Change “study aura” to “read aura”

### Page 212: Clever Counterspell
**Clever Counterspell**: Change “Quick Recognize” to “Quick Recognition”

### Page 397: Splash of art
**Splash of art**: Change “sluggish” to “clumsy”

### Page 594: Greater Staff of Necromancy
***Greater staff of necromancy*** (4th level): Change “enervation” to “vampiric touch”

### Page 35 sidebar: Clan Dagger 
**Add to sidebar**: Clan Dagger You get one clan dagger of your clan for free, as it was given to you at birth. Selling this clan dagger is a terrible taboo and earns you the disdain of other dwarves.

### Page 37: Mountain’s Stoutness
In Mountain’s Stoutness, change the third sentence to “When you have the dying condition, the DC of your recovery checks is equal to 9 + your dying value (instead of 10 + your dying value).” Change the second paragraph to “If you also have the Toughness feat, the Hit Points gained from it and this feat are cumulative, and the DC of your recovery checks is equal to 6 + your dying value.” 

### Page 41: Universal Longevity
**Universal Longevity**: Change “Elven Longevity” to “Ancestral Longevity”

### Page 44: Gnome Weapon Familiarity
Gnome Weapon Familiarity grants access to kukris as well as all uncommon gnome weapons. Change the first sentence of the second paragraph to “In addition, you gain access to kukris and all uncommon gnome weapons.” 

### Page 52 and 59: Halfling and Orc Weapon Familiarity
Halfling and Orc Weapon Familiarity has the wrong language for how to treat weapons with the halfling or orc trait; all ancestries with Weapon Familiarity should only treat the weapons as a different category for the purpose of determining proficiency. Change the final sentence to "For the purpose of determining your proficiency, martial halfling/orc weapons are simple weapons and advanced halfling/orc weapons are martial weapons."

### Page 55: Human Languages
Humans are supposed to have one more language. Change the additional languages to 

> "1 + your Intelligence modifier."

###  Changes to All Classes for Unarmed Attack Proficiency and Benefits
Any class feature that improves the proficiency rank or grants the critical specialization effect access for simple weapons or a specific set of weapons, that ability also grants that benefit for unarmed attacks.

###  Changes to the Greater Juggernaut, Greater Resolve, Improved Evasion, and Third Path to Perfection class features
All three of these abilities grant a two-tier benefit on a failed saving throw of the specified type, but (as always) no ability will ever change your degree of success by more than one step. To clarify, we’re making the following clarification to all three abilities. Change the beginning of the last sentence from “When you fail” a given saving throw to “When you roll a failure on” a giving saving throw. 


### Page 73: Chirurgeon elixirs
In the alchemist's Chirurgeon section, change “lesser elixir of life” to “minor elixir of life.” The lesser elixir of life is a 3rd-level item that a 1st-level character can’t create.

In the Mutagenist section, remove the second paragraph, which provides an obsolete benefit. Replace it with the following free action.

> **Mutagenic Flashback [free-action]**   
    Alchemist, Manipulate   
    Frequency once per day   
    You experience a brief resurgence of a mutagen. Choose one mutagen you’ve consumed since your last daily preparations. You gain the effects of that mutagen for 1 minute.

### Pages 75, 79, and 81: alchemist class feats
Several alchemist class feats reference benefits for alchemical items “you created,” which isn’t relevant in the wider rule set. Remove “you created” from Feral Mutagen, Elastic Mutagen, Invincible Mutagen, Expanded Splash, Genius Mutagen, Persistent Mutagen, and Mindblank Mutagen.

### Page 79: Merciful Elixir
In the alchemist's Merciful Elixir class feat, add to the end of the last sentence 

> “using the item’s level and a counteract modifier equal to your class DC – 10.” 

to define the counteract modifier.

### Page 81: Improbable Elixirs
In the alchemist's Improbable Elixirs class feature, change the third and fourth sentences to read 

> “You gain formulas to create these potions as alchemical items with the elixir trait. When making these alchemical elixirs, you can substitute alchemical reagents for an equal value of magical components, and you can use alchemist’s tools (for Quick Alchemy) or an alchemist’s lab (for the Craft activity) instead of any other required tool kits.”

### Page 85: greater juggernaut
In the barbarian's greater juggernaut class feature, change the last sentence to read 

> “When you roll a failure on a Fortitude save against an effect that deals damage, you halve the damage you take.” 

This removes confusion about how to handle critical failures on saves against damaging effects.

### Page 86: Animal Instincts
In Table 3–3: Animal Instincts, change the deer’s Damage entry to 1d10 P and replace the “charge” trait with the “grapple” trait.

### Page 87: Titan Mauler
In the barbarian's Titan Mauler (Instinct Ability), change 

> “You gain access to a weapon one size larger than you” 

to 

> “You gain access to this larger weapon” 

This accounts for Small creatures using a weapon built for a Large creature, as stated in the previous sentence.

### Page 90: Wounded Rage
In the barbarian's Wounded Rage class feat, remove the Rage trait.

### Page 91: Terrifying Howl
In the barbarian's Terrifying Howl class feat, change 

> “each creature” 

to 

> “each enemy.”

### Page 93: Dragon Transformation
The barbarian's Dragon Transformation class feat uses your class DC for the breath weapon at 16th and at 18th levels, rather than the DC listed for 18th level.

### Page 93: Brutal Critical 
In the barbarian's Brutal Critical class feat, change the second sentence to read 

> “On a critical hit with a melee Strike, add one extra damage die.” 

### Pages 101–102: Eclectic Skill
In the bard's Eclectic Skill class feat, change the second sentence to 

> “Your proficiency bonus to untrained skill checks is equal to your level.” 

This matches the language of the Untrained Improvisation general feat and removes any ambiguity as to whether they combine.

### Page 103: Effortless Concentration
Remove the Requirement in the bard's Effortless Concentration to match all the other Effortless Concentration feats.

### Page 108: Deific Weapon
In the champion's Deific Weapon class feature, change the second sentence to read “If it’s an unarmed attack with a d4 damage die or a simple weapon, increase the damage die by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12).

### Page 108: Divine Ally
In the champion's Divine Ally feat, change the first three sentences to read “A spirit of battle dwells within your armaments. Select one weapon or handwraps of mighty blows when you make your daily preparations. In your hands, the item gains the effect of a property rune.” This supports champions with a deity that has an unarmed attack as a favored weapon.

### Page 112: Smite Evil
Add tenets of good to the Prerequisites of Smite Evil. We accidentally omitted it.

### Page 113: Blade of Justice
Blade of Justice should not be limited to paladins only. Remove the paladin prerequisite from Blade of Justice, and the last sentence becomes 

> "Whether or not the target is evil, you can convert all the physical damage from the attack into good damage, and if you are a paladin, the Strike applies all effects that normally apply on a Retributive Strike (such as divine smite)."

### Page 121: Deadly Simplicity
Deadly Simplicity had a benefit for unarmed attack favored weapons, but such clerics did not actually qualify. Change the prerequisites to add unarmed attacks.

### 10th-level Spells
Several classes were accidentally missing an important limitation for 10th level spells. In the following class features, add 

> “You can’t use this spell slot for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or that give you more spell slots.”

- **Page 121**: Miraculous Spell
- **Page 133**: Primal Hierophant 
- **Page 207**: Archwizard's Spellcraft

### Page 125: Emblazon Antimagic
Emblazon Antimagic has the wrong counteract level. Change it to 

> "your counteract level is equal to half your level, rounded up"

### Page 129: Druid C;a DC
Druid mistakenly was trained in a class DC, when it shouldn't have a class DC. Remove it.

### Page 132: Druid Spells per Day
In "Table 3–11: Druid Spells per Day", change the Cantrips entry at each level from 4 to 5, just like other spellcasters.

### Page 135: Poison Resistance
Remove the “one-action” glyph from the druid's Poison Resistance class feat. This benefit is perpetual.

### Page 138: Plant Shape
In Plant Shape, the level of the plant form spell if you don't have Wild Shape wasn't clear. It should say it's 

> "heightened to the same level as your highest druid spell slot"

### Page 139: Hierophant's Power
Hierophant's Power wasn't supposed to have the prerequisite of legendary in Nature; it's a holdover from the playtest. Remove the prerequisite.

### Page 145: Aid reaction
The adjustment to the Aid reaction after the playtest caused Assisting Shot not to do anything. Replace it with this version. 

> **Assisting Shot [one-action] Feat 2**  
> Fighter, Press  
> Requirements You are wielding a ranged weapon.  
> With a quick shot, you interfere with a foe in combat. Make a Strike with a ranged weapon. If the strike hits, the next creature other than you to attack the same target before the start of your next turn gains a +1 circumstance bonus on their roll, or a +2 circumstance bonus if your Strike was a critical hit.  

### Page 151: Incredible Ricochet
In the fighter's Incredible Ricochet class feat, the narrative of the feat involves using the first shot to help target the next shot. Change the second sentence to 

> “Make a ranged weapon Strike against a creature you previously attacked this turn.”

### Page 152: Determination
Determination has the wrong counteract level. Change it to 

> "your counteract level is equal to half your level, rounded up"

### Page 156: Powerful Fist
In the monk's Powerful Fist class feature, in the second sentence replace “changes” with “increases” to make it clear the normal rules on increases to die sizes apply.

### Page 157: Ki Spells
In the monk's Key Terms sidebar, under the Ki Spells entry, add “and your key spellcasting ability is Wisdom” to the end of the second paragraph.

### Pages 159 and 163: Mountain Stance & Tangled Forest Stance
In the monk's Mountain Stance and Tangled Forest Stance class feats, change the “Trigger” heading to “Requirements.” The content of each entry remains the same.

### Page 163: Sleeper Hold
Sleeper Hold shouldn't have the attack trait, meaning it doesn't apply or increase your multiple attack penalty.

### Page 164: 
Change the action glyph for the monk's Stance Savant class feat to [free-action] instead of [reaction].

### Page 165: Master of Many Styles
Master of Many Styles lists "Your turn begins" as a requirement, but it should be a trigger. Change it to a trigger. 

### Page 169: Nature’s Edge
In the ranger's nature’s edge class feature, remove “on natural uneven ground” as it's redundant. 

### Page 172: Disrupt Prey
Change the action glyph for the ranger's Disrupt Prey class feat to [reaction] instead of [free-action].

### Page 174: Terrain Master
In the ranger's Terrain Master class feat, remove “wild stride” from the Prerequisites entry.

### Page 175: Lightning Snares
In the ranger's Lightning Snares class feat, add “Quick Snares” to the Prerequisites entry.

### Page 176: Stealthy Companion
In the ranger's Stealthy Companion class feat, add “Animal Companion” to the Prerequisites entry.

### Page 177: Manifold Edge Clarification
In order to make it completely clear how the Manifold Edge feat works, change the second sentence to read 

> "When you use Hunt Prey, you can gain a hunter’s edge benefit other than the one you selected at 1st level." 

With the previous wording, a few people thought you gained both benefits, rather than a substitution.

### Page 184: Minor Magic
In the rogue's Minor Magic class feat, add the following sentence. 

> “Your key spellcasting ability is Charisma, and you’re trained in spell attack rolls and DCs for the tradition of your chosen cantrips.”

### Page 185: Poison Weapon
In the rogue's Poison Weapon class feat, if you're already holding the poison, you shouldn't need a free hand. Remove 

> “and have a free hand” 

from the Requirements and remove 

> “and have a free hand” 

from the Requirements entry and change the first sentence to read 

> “You apply a poison to the required weapon; if you’re not holding a poison and have a free hand, you can Interact to draw a poison as part of this action.”

### Page 188: Blank Slate
Blank Slate, like a few other entries, was still erroneously running on a level 1 to 20 scale for counteract levels. Replace 

> "counteract level of 20"  

with 

> "counteract level of 10."

### Page 189: Dispelling Slice
Dispelling Slice should use the default counteract level of 

> "half your level (rounded up)" 

in the final sentence. 

### Page 194: Sorcerer 17th Level Class Feature
Add the following sorcerer class feature at 17th level:

> **Resolve**  
> You’ve steeled you mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increase to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.

### Page 197:  Elemental Type
In the sorcerer's Elemental Type section of the elemental bloodline, change the last sentence to read 

> “Replace any existing elemental traits with the trait of the element you chose.”

### Page 199: Bespell Weapon Level
In the Sorcerer Feats sidebar, change the level of “Bespell Weapon” from 6 to 4 to match the feat itself.

### Page 201: Greater Mental Evolution
Remove the arcane trait from Greater Mental Evolution and the divine trait from Greater Vital Evolution, both sorcerer class feats.

### Pages 204 and 206: Wizard Feat
Wizards gain their first class feat at 2nd level, like other spellcasters. On page 204, in Table 3-18: 
Wizard Advancement, remove “wizard feat” from the 1st-level entry. On page 206, in the Wizard Feats section, change the first sentence to 

> “At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a wizard class feat.”

### Page 205: Drain Bonded Item
In Drain Bonded Item, remove the unnecessary Requirement of 

> "Your turn begins."

### Page 214: Animan Companions
In the first paragraph, replace the first two sentences with the following to clarify the specific action required to command your animal companion, and that it doesn’t require a check. 

Replace with:

> An animal companion is a loyal comrade who follows your orders. Your animal companion has the minion trait, and it gains 2 actions during your turn if you use the Command an Animal action to command it; this is in place of the usual effects of Command an Animal, and you don’t need to attempt a Nature check."

### Page 214: Young Animal Companions
Under Young Animal Companions, add the sentence 

> “An animal companion has the same level you do.” 

In the same paragraph, change the maximum item bonus to AC an animal companion can gain from +2 to +3. 

### Page 217: Ambusher
In the ambusher section, remove 

> “It gains a +2 circumstance bonus to initiative rolls using Stealth” 

since a companion acts on your initiative and therefore this clause provides no benefit.

### Page 217: Familiars' level
Familiars' level wasn't explicit. Add 

> "A familiar has the same level you do." 

The description of familiars didn't define any Strikes but also wasn't explicit that they couldn't make them. Add 

> "It can't make Strikes" 

to the beginning of the third sentence.

### Page 219: Spellcasting Archetypes
Under Spellcasting Archetypes, in the Basic Spellcasting Feat, change the second sentence to 

> “At 6th level, they grant you a 2nd‑level spell slot, and if you have a spell repertoire, you can select one spell from your repertoire as a signature spell.” 

In the Expert Spellcasting Feat, after the first sentence, add 

> “If you have a spell repertoire, you can select a second spell from your repertoire as a signature spell.” 

In the Master Spellcasting Feat, after the first sentence, add 

> “If you have a spell repertoire, you can select a third spell from your repertoire as a signature spell.” 

###  Spellcasting Dedication Feats (pages 222, 224, 225, and 230)
In the spellcasting dedication feats, you can prepare or add to your repertoire common cantrips of your spellcasting tradition, whether from this book or other cantrips of that tradition you learn or discover. 

### Page 230: Sorcerer Dedication
In the Sorcerer Dedication feat, replace the second sentence of the second paragraph with 

> “You gain a spell repertoire with two common cantrips from the spell list associated with your bloodline, from the spells granted by your bloodline, or any other cantrips of that tradition you learn or discover.” 

This grants access to the bloodline-granted cantrips as well as those on the associated spell list. 

### Page 233: Repeated Skill Trainign
Clarifying the general rule on repeated skill training that gives you a replacement skill, add at the end of the second paragraph 

> "though if the skill is a Lore skill, the new skill must also be a Lore skill"

### Page 242: Grapple
In Grapple, the restrained condition doesn't technically also make a creature grabbed, so to make it clear, in the requirements of the action and at the end of the first paragraph about not needing a hand if you're already grabbing someone, change "grabbed" to "grabbed or restrained"

### Page 244: Craft downtime activity
The Craft downtime activity requires an alchemist’s lab, not just alchemist’s tools. See the errata for page 287. 

### Page 248: healer's tools
To reflect the clarification on healer's tools allowing you to draw them as part of the action if you're wearing them, change the Requirements to 

> "You are holding healer's tools, or you are wearing them and have a hand free"

### Page 249: Drop Prone
Add "Drop Prone" to the list of basic commands you can tell your animal friend to lie down.

### Page 255: Automatoiv Knowledge
In "Table 5–2: General Skill Feats", change the description of Automatic Knowledge from 

> “once per day” 

to 

> “once per round.” 

It was correct in the text but not the table.

### Page 258: Battle Medicine
In Battle Medicine, change the Requirements entry to 

> “You are holding or wearing healer's tools.” 

Change the second sentence of the effect to 

> “Attempt a Medicine check with the same DC as for Treat Wounds, and restore a corresponding amount of Hit Points; this does not remove the wounded condition.” 

This means you need to use your healer's tools for Battle Medicine, but you can draw and replace worn tools as part of the action due to the errata on wearing tools on page 287. 

- *Update*: We will be updating the tools revamp to indicate that worn healer's tools (along with other tool kits) take only one hand to use, as you don't have to hold the whole kit in your other hand, just pull out the things you need. What this means for Battle Medicine is that you only need one free hand to perform it with worn healer's tools, you don't need both hands.  

### Page 259: Bonded Animal
Bonded Animal didn't explain the logistics of bonding the animal directly, leading a small number of people to be unsure that it was necessary to locate and interact with the animal to bond with it. To make it explicit, change the second sentence to 

> "You can spend 7 days of downtime regularly interacting with a normal animal (…) that is friendly or helpful to you."

### Page 260: Cloud Jump
The Cloud Jump feat referred to exceeding a "limit" without spelling out exactly which limit. It's supposed to be the limit of not being able to Leap farther than your Speed. To make it clear, change the second paragraph to read 

> "You can jump a distance greater than your Speed by spending additional actions when you Long Jump or High Jump. For each additional action spent, add your Speed to the limit on how far you can Leap." 

As an example, supposing you had a Speed of 40 feet and 25 on your Athletics check, Cloud Jump triples the 25 feet to 75 feet, but the limit of 40 feet still applies so you would jump 40 feet. If you spent another action, the limit based on your Speed would raise from 40 feet to 80 feet, so you would jump 75 feet.

### Page 260: Connections
The Connections feat requires a great deal of improvisation and adjudication on the part of a GM, more in line with an option that has uncommon rarity due to the narrative load. Because of this, change the feat's rarity to uncommon.

### Page 260: Dubious Knowledge
Dubious Knowledge's effect should only happen on a failure, not a critical failure. Change the effect to explicitly state it doesn't occur on a critical failure.

### Page 268: Action
Because the word "action" could have broad or narrow scopes, it wasn't clear exactly when you could use the Unified Theory feat to substitute Arcana for the other magical skills. Change the beginning of the second sentence to 

> "Whenever you use a skill action or a skill feat" to make it clear you can use it with skill actions (such as the ones in Chapter 4) and skill feat, but not for other actions, such as  when casting spells or rituals.

### Page 268: Toughness
In Toughness, change the last sentence to read 

> “The DC of recovery checks is equal to 9 + your dying condition value (page 459).” 

###  Held, Worn, and Stowed Items

#### Page 271: Carrying Gear
We've simplified the way we're handling characters carrying their gear so that you can define all your carried items in one of three categories. Replace the "carrying and using items" section with this text: 

> "A character carries items in three ways: held, worn, and stowed. Held items are in your hands; a character typically has two hands, allowing them to hold an item in each hand or a single two-handed item using both hands. Worn items are tucked into pockets, belt pouches, bandoliers, weapon sheaths, and so forth, and they can be retrieved and returned relatively quickly. Stowed items are in a backpack or a similar container, and they are more difficult to access. Drawing a worn item or changing how you’re carrying an item usually requires you to use an Interact action (though to drop an item, you use the Release action instead). Table 6–2:  Changing Equipment on page 273 lists some ways that you might change the items you’re holding or carrying, and the number of hands you need to do so. Many ways of using items require you to spend multiple actions. For example, drinking a potion worn at your belt requires using an Interact action to draw it and then using a second action to drink it as described in its Activate entry (page 532)." 

This change also removes several sorts of "container" items from the tables on 286-292, as they are no longer tracked separately from the items they store. These are: 

- bandolier
- belt pouch
- satchel
- scroll case 
- sheath
- vial 

#### Page 287: Wearing Tools 

> "You can make a set of tools (such as alchemist’s tools or healer’s tools) easier to use by wearing it. This allows you to draw and replace the tools as part of the action that uses them. You can wear up to 2 Bulk of tools in this manner; tools beyond this limit must be stowed or drawn with an Interact action to use." Fine clothing reduces that limit to light Bulk worth of tools.""

*Update*: Worn tools should only take 1 hand to use, as you only draw the things you need from the kit and not the entire kit. This has been marked for future errata.

### Page 275: Armor Traits
Under the Armor Traits heading, change the entry for Noisy to 

> “Noisy: This armor is loud and likely to alert others to your presence. The armor’s check penalty applies to Stealth checks even if you meet the required Strength score.” 

### Page 278: Improvised Weapons
Under Improvised Weapons, add the sentence 

> “Improvised weapons are simple weapons.” 

This dictates the proficiency modifier you use. 

### Page 278: Critical hits
In critical hits, 

> "When you make an attack and roll a natural 20...or if the result of your attack exceeds the target's AC by 10" 

was too broad a brush and thus slightly inaccurate for how to determine a critical hit, in an attempt to state the conditions succinctly. Replace the first section with 

> "When you make an attack and succeed with a natural 20" 

so that's it's clear the natural 20 must succeed based on the total result in order to get a critical success.

### Page 280: Ammunition
Under the Ammunition heading, add the sentence “Using ammunition destroys it.” 

### Page 283: Weapon traits

- In the definition of the Parry weapon trait, change *"spend an Interact action"* to *"spend a single action"* to make it so setting up a parry doesn't trigger Attacks of Opportunity or similar reactions.
- In the definition for the thrown weapon trait, change the first sentence to *“You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack, and it is a ranged weapon when thrown.”*
- In the definition for the unarmed weapon trait, the sentence *"a fist or other grasping appendage follows the same rules as a free-hand weapon"* was worded in such a way it confused a few people, who thought that meant those unarmed attacks were weapons, despite statements to the contrary on page 278. To make it clear, change that section to read *"a fist or other grasping appendage generally works like a free-hand weapon"*

### Page 283: Critical Specialization Effects
In Critical Specialization Effects, it uses the generic term attack but should specifically refer to Strikes. In the first sentence, change 

> "when you make an attack with certain weapons" 

to 

> "when you make a Strike with certain weapons"

### Page 288: Adventurer's Pack Price
Change the price of the the adventurer's pack to 15 sp and the bedroll to 2 cp.

### Page 289: Bulk & Kits

### Page 292: Alchemical Gear
On Table 6–11: Alchemical Gear and under the Elixirs heading, change 

> “lesser elixir of life” 

to 

> “minor elixir of life.” 

The other statistics for this item remain unchanged. 

### Page 293: Magical Gear
In Table 6–12: Magical Gear, change the Price of the minor healing potion from 3 gp to 4 gp. It was correct in the main entry on page 563.

### Page 293: Consumable Magic Items
Under Consumable Magic Items, change holy water to deal 

> “1d6 good damage and 1 good splash damage.” 

Change unholy water to deal 

> “1d6 evil damage and 1 evil splash damage” 

instead of “1d6 good damage.” 

###  Changes to Make Bulk Less Restrictive 
The following changes make Bulk limits less restrictive for your character. 

#### Page 287: Alchemist’s lab
**Add the following entry for an alchemist’s lab:**
> **Alchemist’s Lab**: You need an alchemist’s lab to Craft alchemical items during downtime. An expanded alchemist’s lab gives a +1 item bonus to Crafting checks to create alchemical items. 

#### Page 287: Alchemist’s Tools
**Amend the Alchemist’s Tools entry to the following:**
> **Alchemist’s Tools**: This mobile collection of vials and chemicals can be used for simple alchemical tasks. 

#### Page 287: Backpack
In the Backpack description, add this sentence: 

> “The first 2 Bulk of items in your backpack don’t count against your Bulk limits.” 

Similarly 

> "The first 1 Bulk of items in each saddlebag doesn't count against your mount's Bulk limits."

#### Page 288: 
Make the following changes on "Table 6–9: Adventuring Gear."

- Change the Bulk of the adventurer’s pack from 2 to 1. 
- Change the Bulk of formula book (blank) and spellbook (blank) from 1 to L 
- Add “Alchemist’s Lab” (Price 5 gp, Bulk 6, Hands 2) 
- Change “Expanded Alchemist’s Tools (level 3)” to “Expanded Alchemist’s Lab” as a sub-entry to the new alchemist’s lab, and change the Bulk from 1 to 6 
- Change the alchemist’s tools Price from 5 gp to 3 gp, and the Bulk from 2 to 1 

### Page 292: Waterskin
The waterskin is always light Bulk, whether full or empty. 

### Page 300: Cantrips & Slots
The text on cantrips was confusing and implied that they might use spell slots, even though they don't. Change the second to last sentence in the first paragraph to 

> "If you're a prepared spellcaster, you can prepare a specific number of cantrips each day. You can't prepare a cantrip in a spell slot."

### Page 303: Component Substitutions
In the Component Substitutions sidebar, replace the second paragraph with the following to avoid implying changes to action traits. 

Replace with:

> If you’re a bard Casting a Spell from the occult tradition, you can usually play an instrument for spells requiring somatic or material components, as long as it takes at least one of your hands to do so. If you use an instrument, you don’t need a spell component pouch or another hand free. You can usually also play an instrument for spells requiring verbal components, instead of speaking.

Also add a final one-sentence paragraph covering innate spells: 

> Any character casting an innate spell can replace any material component with a somatic component.

### Pages 316–407: Attack Trait Spells
Remove the attack trait from the spells Abyssal plague, chill touch, death knell, ghoulish cravings, goblin pox, mariner’s curse, outcast’s curse, spider sting, spiritual guardian, spiritual weapon, savor the sting, touch of undeath (the cleric focus spell), and force bolt. 

### Pages 316-407 and 573: Damaging spells
Damaging spells and items meant to harm PCs do way too much damage for your gear to survive if it could be targeted, so such spells almost never are supposed to be able to damage objects. A few target lines slipped by with "creatures or objects." 

Remove the ability to target or damage objects from 

- acid splash 
- acid arrow
- eclipse burst
- polar ray
- sunburst
- fire ray
- moon beam
- force bolt
- horn of blasting. 

Limit *hydraulic push* to "creatures and unattended objects."

### Page 318: Animal messenger
In *animal messenger*, change the duration to “see text.” Change the spell description to state that the spell ends after 24 hours or when a creature removes the attached object, whichever happens first. 

### Page 318 and 400: Antimagic Field & Storm lord
In *antimagic field* and storm lord, you can't exclude yourself from the emanation as you can for many other emanations, so change the area to explicitly states "which affects you."

### Pages 322 and 390: Charm & Charming Touch
In the success entries for *charm* (page 322) and charming touch (page 390), replace references to *Identify Magic* with a reference to the *Identifying Spells* section on page 305. 

### Page 330, 358, 377: Attack trait additions
Add the attack trait to 

- disintegrate
- polar ray
- tanglefoot

### Page 331: cantrip trait
Add the cantrip trait to 

- disrupt undead

### Page 336: Enlarge
In *enlarge*, change the Heightened (6th) entry to read 

> “Choose either the 2nd-level or 4th-level version of this spell and apply its effects to 10 willing creatures.” 

in case you want to make a large number of creatures Large but Huge would be too big for your circumstances.

### Page 338, 346, 379, 400: sustained spells
Several sustained spells are meant to provide once per turn benefits when they are sustained, not be used multiple times per turn. In 

- flaming sphere 
- implosion
- unfathomable song
- impaling briars
- storm lord 

add 

> "the first time you Sustain this Spell each round" 

### Page 339: Flesh to stone
Once *flesh to stone* has completely petrified you, the spell ends but you still remain petrified, meaning you can't remove the effects with dispel magic or similar abilities that counteract active spells; you need stone to flesh. Change the last two sentences of the failure condition to read 

> "When a creature is unable to act due to the slowed condition from flesh to stone, the creature is permanently non-magically petrified. The spell ends if the creature is petrified or the slowed condition is removed."

### Page 343: Harm
In *harm*, change the description of the 3-action version to read 

> “you disperse negative energy” 

instead of positive energy. 

### Page 343: heroism
Even if you aren't a humanoid, you too can be a hero. In heroism, remove "humanoid" from the targets line so it just reads "1 creature"

### Page 345: Illusory disguise
*Illusory disguise*, a Perception check to disbelieve just happens, it isn't a free action, so change 

> "attempt a Perception check to disbelieve the spell as a free action" 

to read 

> "attempt an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the spell."

### Page 348: Light
In *light*, change the Targets entry to read 

> “1 object of 1 Bulk or less, either unattended or possessed by you or a willing ally” 

### Page 349: Magic fang/Weapon
Some corner cases in *magic fang* and *magic weapon*. In magic fang, change the Targets entry to “1 willing creature.” Change the first sentence to 

> “Choose one of the target’s unarmed attacks.” Change the last sentence to

> “The unarmed attack becomes a +1 striking unarmed attack, gaining a +1 item bonus to attack rolls and increasing the number of damage dice to two if it had only one.” 

This makes the spell less restrictive and more versatile. In magic weapon change the Targets entry to remove the word "nonmagical" so you can still cast it on a +1 weapon to get the extra striking die.

### Page 358: Polar ray
Polar ray left out what happened on a critical hit with your spell attack roll. It should double the damage (but not the drained value) on a critical hit.

### Page 362: Purple worm sting
Purple worm sting used to have both a spell attack roll and a Fortitude save, but in changing to only a save, some of the damage is now automatic and should be reduced. Reduce the piercing damage automatically taken from the spell to 3d6.

### Page 363: Regenerate
The *regenerate* spell had an incorrect interaction with the doomed condition that would cause a doomed character to still die while regenerating. To handle that, instead of preventing a creature from progressing to dying 3, change it to 

> "its dying condition can't increase to a value that would kill it (this stops most creatures from going beyond dying 3)."

### Page 370: Sound burst
In *sound burst*, change the critical failure entry to read 

> “The creature takes double damage, is deafened for 1 minute, and is stunned 1.” 

since stunned doesn't have a duration.

### Page 373: Spiritual weapon
In *spiritual weapon*, you might not have a deity, particularly if you're an occult caster, so change it to manifest a "a club, a dagger, or your deity's favored weapon."

### Page 377: Telekinetic haul
*Telekinetic haul* should work only on unattended objects, not objects in creatures' possessions.

### Page 377: telekinetic projectile
In *telekinetic projectile*, change the second sentence to read 

> “Make a spell attack roll against the target.” 

It was accidentally missing the word "spell" before, meaning the attack roll wasn't explicitly classified as weapon, unarmed, or spell.

### Page 377: Tangling creepers
In tangling creepers, instead of having the creepers make an unarmed attack using your spell attack modifier, change it to just say 

> "Make a melee spell attack roll against the target."

### Page 379: true target
In true target, the way the spell used its targets was confusing, and it wasn't clear it applied to more attacks. There are several changes to make this clear; 

Here is the final text with changes in bold:

> **TRUE TARGET SPELL 7**  
> DIVINATION FORTUNE PREDICTION  
> Traditions arcane, occult  
> Cast [one-action] verbal  
> Range 60 feet; Targets 4 creatures  
> Duration until the start of your next turn  
> You delve into the possible futures of the next few seconds to understand all the ways your foe might avoid harm, then cast out a vision of that future to your allies. Designate a creature. The first time each target makes an attack roll against that creature during true target’s duration, the attacker rolls twice and uses the better result. The attacker also ignores circumstance penalties to the attack roll and any flat check required due to the designated creature being concealed or hidden.  

### Page 381: visions of danger
In *visions of danger*, there's no description of what the Will save does, other than the critical success allowing you to disbelieve. It should be a basic Will save against the mental damage.

### Page 385: zealous conviction
In *zealous conviction*, add the emotion and mental traits.

### Page 390: 
In *charming touch*, remove "humanoid" from the target line so you can charm any kind of creature that could find you attractive.

### Page 391: death’s call
In *death’s call*, replace 

> “your Wisdom modifier” 

with 

> “your spellcasting ability modifier” 

so that champions aren't forced to use Wisdom.

### Page 393: healer's blessing
In healer's blessing, boost the additional healing from the base spell from 1 to 2.

### Page 399: goodberry
Replace the existing goodberry focus spell with the following. 

> **GOODBERRY FOCUS 1**  
 Uncommon, Druid, Healing, Necromancy  
 Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal   
 Range touch; Targets 1 ripe berry   
 Duration 10 minutes   
 You imbue the target berry with the bounty of nature, turning it into a goodberry that can heal and sustain far beyond its normal capacity. A creature can eat the goodberry with an Interact action to regain 1d6+4 Hit Points. A berry not consumed during the duration withers away. Every six goodberries consumed gives as much nourishment as one square meal for a typical human.   
 **Heightened** (+1) You can target an additional berry. A creature can consume any number of goodberries from the same casting with a single Interact action. 

### Page 403: Angelic halo
Angelic halo should scale based on the level of the heal spell, not based on angelic halo's level. Remove the heightened entry and instead, replace the status bonus to healing from the spell with 

> "Allies in your halo’s emanation who are healed by a heal spell gain a status bonus to Hit Points regained equal to double the heal spell’s level."

### Page 409: Atone
In the atone ritual, change the Heightened entry to “Heightened (+1).” 

### Page 438: Desna
Under Desna, change “3rd: dream message” to “4th: fly.” 

### Page 438: Iomedae
Under Iomedae, change “2nd: see invisibility” to “2nd: enlarge.” 

### Page 441: Whispering Way
Add to the Whispering Way “Follower Alignments LE, NE, CE” 

### Page 446: Attack Rolls
Attack Rolls. There was some confusion as to whether skill checks with the attack trait (such as Grapple or Trip) are also attack rolls at the same time. They are not. To make this clear,  add this sentence to the beginning of the definition of attack roll 

> "When you use a Strike action or make a spell attack, you attempt a check called an attack roll." 

To clarify the different rules elements involved:

- An **attack** is any check that has the **attack trait**. It applies and increases the multiple attack penalty.
- An **attack roll** is one of the core types of checks in the game (along with saving throws, skill checks, and Perception checks). They are used for Strikes and spell attacks, and traditionally target Armor Class.
- Some skill actions have the **attack trait**, specifically Athletics actions such as Grapple and Trip. You still make a skill check with these skills, not an attack roll.
- The **multiple attack penalty** applies on those skill actions as well. As it says later on in the definition of attack roll "Striking multiple times in a turn has diminishing returns. The multiple attack penalty (detailed on page 446) applies to each attack after the first, whether those attacks are Strikes, special attacks like the Grapple action of the Athletics skill, or spell attack rolls." There is inaccurate language in the Multiple Attack Penalty section implying it applies only to attack rolls that will be receiving errata.

### Page 451: Calculating damage rolls
Following the formulas for calculating damage rolls, add the sentence 

> “If the combined penalties on an attack would reduce the damage to 0 or below, you still deal 1 damage.” 

Resistances and the like can still reduce the damage to 0.

### Page 452: Bleed Damage
At the end of the description of bleed damage, add 

> "Bleed damage ends automatically if you’re healed to your full Hit Points."

### Page 453: Weaknesses
Weaknesses like "salt" and "water" weren't fully explained. At the beginning of the second paragraph in weakness, add 

> "If you have a weakness to something that doesn’t normally deal damage, such as water, you take damage equal to the weakness value when touched or affected by it."

### Page 453 and 634: Nonlethal Attacks
In Nonlethal Attacks, nonlethal effects other than Strikes weren't explained directly, so at the end add 

> "Spells and other effects with the nonlethal trait that reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points knock the creature out instead of killing them" On page 634, add the nonlethal trait "An effect with this trait is nonlethal. Damage from a nonlethal effect knocks a creature out rather than killing it."

### Page 457: Emanation
In the Emanation section, add the following sentence to the end. 

> “Unless the text states otherwise, the creature creating an emanation effect chooses whether the creature at its center is affected.” 

This means that you can cast spells like harm without damaging yourself.

### Page 459: Knocked Out and Dying
In the first bullet point under Knocked Out and Dying, change the sentence to 

> “You immediately move your initiative position to directly before the turn in which you were reduced to 0 HP.”

 This was originally intended, and prevents weird situations where you are knocked out by a reaction and die without having a chance for your allies to help you.

### Page 460: Heroic Recovery
Under Heroic Recovery, replace the first sentence with the following to align with other places in the text that discuss spending Hero Points. 

> “If you have at least 1 Hero Point (page 467), you can spend all of your remaining Hero Points at the start of your turn or when your dying value would increase. You lose the dying condition entirely and stabilize with 0 Hit Points. You don’t gain the wounded condition or increase its value from losing the dying condition in this way, but if you already had that condition, you don’t lose it or decrease its value.” 

### Page 461: 
Add a new section after Temporary Hit Points: 

> _Fast Healing and Regeneration_  
 Some abilities grant fast healing, and some creatures have regeneration. A creature with either ability regains the listed amount of Hit Points each round at the beginning of its turn. A creature with regeneration has additional benefits. Its dying condition can’t increase to a value that would kill it (this stops most creatures from going beyond dying 3) as long as its regeneration is active. If it takes damage of a type listed in the regeneration entry, its regeneration deactivates until the end of its next turn, including against the triggering damage.


### Page 481: Retraining
Retraining. It wasn't clear how long it took to retrain spells in a spell repertoire, but it should take just 1 week. Add 

> "Some, like changing a spell in your spell repertoire, take a week." 

to retraining class features.

### Page 421: Disabling a Hazard
How to run disabling a hazard with skills other than Thievery wasn't completely clear. Add 

> "Like using Disable a Device, using these skills to disable a trap is a 2-action activity with the same degrees of success, though the activity might have different traits determined by the GM."

### Page 535: Craft Requirements
Add text about upgrading an item from a lower-level version into a higher-level version. 

> "The GM might allow you to Craft a permanent item from a lower-level version of the same item as an upgrade. For example, you might upgrade a bag of holding from a type I to a type II bag, but you couldn’t upgrade a clear spindle aeon stone into an orange prism aeon stone. The cost for this upgrade is the full difference in Price between the items, and the Crafting check uses a DC for the item’s new level."

### Page 537 and 583: Shadow and slick runes
Shadow and slick runes. Since a character can't actually use those runes unless they have a +1 armor first (a 5th level item), move the items from 3rd level to 5th level when they become usable (keeping the price from the original version, even though it's unusually low for a 5th level item).

### Page 542 and 548: true elixir of life
The true elixir of life's price is incorrect. Change it to 8,000 gp.

### Page 544: Splash trait
The example in the splash trait is confusing. Replace it with this clearer version of the example 

> "For example, if you throw a lesser acid flask and hit your target, that creature takes 1 acid damage, 1d6 persistent acid damage, and 1 acid splash damage. All other creatures within 5 feet of it take 1 acid splash damage. On a critical hit, the target takes 2 acid damage and 2d6 persistent acid damage, but the splash damage is still 1. If you miss, the target and all creatures within 5 feet take only 1 splash damage. If you critically fail, no one takes any damage."

### Page 546: Mutagens 
Under the Mutagens heading, to explain how to handle the counteracting between mutagens, add the following sentence to the end of the second paragraph. 

> “Mutagens are polymorph effects (page 301), and a subsequent polymorph effect attempts to counteract an existing effect; the counteract check for a mutagen uses the item’s level and a modifier equal to the that level’s DC – 10, as found on Table 10–5: DCs by Level (page 503).” 

### Page 548: elixir of life
To make it clearer that elixir of life only works on living creatures due to the healing trait, change the first sentence to 

> "Elixirs of life accelerate a living creature’s natural healing processes and immune system."

### Page 549: Quicksilver mutagen
Quicksilver mutagen's "ranged attack rolls" was meant to apply to ranged weapon attack rolls and ranged unarmed attack rolls, but it makes sense to apply to Dexterity-based melee attack rolls using finesse. Change 

> "ranged attack rolls" 

to 

> "Dexterity-based attack rolls."

### Page 550: Method of Exposure
Under Method of Exposure, in the Injury section, change the first sentence to read 

> “An injury poison is activated by applying it to a weapon or ammunition, and it affects the target of the first Strike made using the poisoned item.” 

This explicitly allows you to poison ammunition as well as weapons. 

### Pages 551–554: Injury poisons
Injury poisons should require 2 actions to apply rather than 3, allowing you to draw a poison and apply it to a weapon on the same turn. Change the Activate entries for the following poisons from a [three-actions] glyph to a [two‑actions] glyph:

- belladonna
- black adder venom
- giant centipede venom
- giant scorpion venom
- giant wasp venom
- graveroot
- hunting spider venom
- lethargy poison
- purple worm venom
- shadow essence
- wyvern poison. 

### Page 551: Deathcap powder
Deathcap powder should be held in 1 hand, like other ingested poisons, not held in 2 hands.

### Page 566: dispelling sliver
In dispelling sliver, add 

> “(counteract modifier +29)” 

to the end of the first paragraph of the effect. 

### Page 573: decanter of endless
In the decanter of endless water, add a usage entry of 2 hands and a Bulk entry of L.

### Page 574: Maestro's instrument
Maestro's instrument should have DCs for the charm effects, DC 27 for  the moderate version and DC 38 for the greater version.

### Page 584: grievous rune
In the grievous rune entry for a spear, change “enfeebled” to “clumsy” to match the spear’s critical specialization effect. 

### Page 586–587: mithral shield
In mithral shield, change the Bulk entries for the standard-grade mithral shield and the high-grade mithral shield from “1” to “L.” 

### Page 587: Arrow-catching shield
This shield had a built in usage frequency based on being fairly fragile that worked in the playtest rules for shields, but switching from dents to HP, the shield became too easily destroyed and needs to offer more protection. Increase the basic shield statistics to Hardness 10, HP 60, BT 30 and add a frequency of once per minute on the activation.

### Page 588: Forge warde
Forge warden's durability is too low. Increase its basic shield statistics to Hardness 10, HP 40, BT 20. 

### Page 592: Staves
Under Staves, change the fourth sentence to 

> “Many staves can be found in multiple versions, with more powerful versions that contain more spells—such a staff always contains the spells of all lower-level versions, in addition to the spells listed in its own entry.”  

This removes the erroneous mention of holding more charges. In preparing a staff, change the second sentence to 

> "When you do so, that staff gains a number of charges equal to the level of your highest spell slot. You don’t need to expend any spells to add charges in this way." 

This makes it clear how many charges you gain if you have only a few low level spell slots but have a cantrip or focus spell. Finally, in attacking with a staff, add 

> "Staves are also staff weapons (page 280). They can be etched with fundamental runes but not property runes. This doesn’t alter any of their spellcasting abilities." 

since staves are specific weapons, with the staff abilities as the additional abilities.

### Page 594: Greater staff of necromancy
Greater staff of necromancy has enervation, a spell that's in Advanced Player's Guide instead of this book. Replace it with a 4th level vampiric touch. 

### Page 597: Broken Wands
Wands become broken when you overcharge them and succeed at the flat check, and you need to know their statistics to Repair them. While they use the normal statistics for a thin item of their composition, it makes sense to call that out. At the end of Varying Statistics, add 

> "A wand has the normal Hardness, BT, and HP of a thin item of its material (page 577)."

### Page 602: Greater storm flash
In the entry for greater storm flash, add a spell DC of 38 to the end of the last sentence, as the greater form of an item should increase the DC to a competitive one for its level. 

### Page 604: Companion Items
Under Companion Items, replace the third sentence with 

> “Normally these are the only items a companion can use. Other items may qualify, at the GM’s discretion, but an animal can never Activate an Item.” 

This makes the rules clearer than before, and allows the GM to opt into adding more items.

### Page 612: Healer's gloves
Healer's gloves' activation was unclear as to whether it was a healing effect. Change the activation effect to the following: 

> "You can soothe the wounds of a willing, living, adjacent creature, restoring 2d6+7 Hit Points to that creature. This is a positive healing effect. You can’t harm undead with this healing."

### Page 618: Broken
In the definition for the broken condition, change the second sentence to 

> “An object is broken when damage has reduced its Hit Points to equal or less than its Broken Threshold.” 

This matches the definition of broken on page 272 (the inconsistency before was what happened when its HP were exactly equal to the Broken Threshold).  

### Page 620, 631, and 454: Fatigued
In the definition of fatigued, the intention is that it prevents the exploration tactics you take while traveling or exploring an area, but you can still stop and Refocus, Treat Wounds, and so on. Change the last sentence to 

> "You can’t use exploration activities performed while traveling, such as those on pages 479–480." 

### Pages 620–623: Attitudes
In the definitions for the friendly, helpful, hostile, indifferent, and unfriendly conditions, change the first sentence to read 

> “This condition reflects a creature’s disposition toward a particular character, and only supernatural effects (like a spell) can impose these conditions on player characters.” 

This continues to reflect the fact that mundane skills can't influence a PC's attitude (unless the player wishes to change it to reflect the other character's persuasive ability) while allowing magic like charm to do so.

### Page 621: Prone & Cover
The prone condition said you could Take Cover to gain cover against ranged attacks, but it should say you gain Greater Cover. When combined with still being flat-footed, it allows you to hunker down for a net of 2 more AC against ranged attacks.

### Page 621: Persistent damage sidebar
Clarifying Assisted Recovery, at the end of the first paragraph, change the last sentence to 

> "This allows you to attempt an extra flat check immediately, but only once per round." 

and add the bullet point 

> "• The action to help might require a skill check or another roll to determine its effectiveness." 

Remove "Administer First Aid" as an example of assisted recovery, as it's a separate action. 

## Pathfinder Core Rulebook Errata (Part 2)

### Page 71: Alchemists Armor Proficiency
Alchemists should have proficiency in medium armor to make things easier for mutagenists who pursue higher Strength and lower Dexterity. Add training in medium armor to their initial proficiencies as well as to their 13th and 19th level armor expertise and mastery class features.

### Page 72-79: Alchemist DC Scaling
Alchemist DC scaling is highly dependent on the feat Powerful Alchemy, so we decided to make it an automatic class feature instead to free up more feats. Add powerful alchemy to the class features at 5th level, and remove it from the list of alchemist class feats.

### Page 73: Reagents
Alchemists at low levels don't have enough reagents to make more than a very small number of items, whereas at higher levels they can make significantly more. To help make those reagents last longer at 1st through 4th levels, add a limited version of the Field Discovery class feature at 1st level. 

> "Your research field adds a number of formulas to your formula book; these are your signature items. When using a batch of infused reagents to create your signature items using advanced alchemy, you create three items instead of two. Each time you gain a level, you can swap one of your signature items with another formula in your formula book. This new signature item must be on your research field’s list of possible signature items."

### Page 75: Alchemical Alacrity
Alchemical Alacrity lets you make three alchemical items, but you can't hold all three, so it's unclear what happens to the third one. Add to the end 

> "and you automatically stow one of these new items as you create them."

### Page 75: Perpetual infusions
In perpetual infusions, "bullheaded mutagen" should say "serene mutagen."

### Page 89: Raging Athlete
The wording has been adjusted to prevent unintended interactions with other abilities while keeping the same benefits. Change the text to 

> "Physical obstacles can’t hold back your fury. While you are raging, you gain a climb Speed and swim Speed equal to your land Speed and the DC of High Jumps and Long Jumps decreases by 10. Your distance for a vertical Leap increases to 5 feet vertically, and your distance for a horizontal Leap increases to 15 feet if your Speed is at least 15 feet and to 20 feet if your Speed is at least 30 feet."

### Page 91: Sudden Leap
Sudden Leap is missing the two-action icon from the fighter version, leaving the action cost unstated. Add in the two action icon.

### Pages 99-103: Bard feats
Various bard feats shouldn't have the "focus pool" prerequisite. If you somehow take them without a focus pool (typically via multiclassing), you gain a focus pool, as normal for taking your first feat that grants a focus spell.

### Pages 102, 201, 211: Quickened Casting
In Quickened Casting, change the restriction to 

> "If your next action is to cast a `Classname` cantrip or a spell that is at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level `Classname` spell slot you have" inserting bard, sorcerer, or wizard as appropriate. This wording change makes it clear how to handle situations where you have a cantrip or focus spell at a different spell level than your highest spell slot.

### Class Chapter All Spellcasters
Change the definition of cantrips to say 

> "A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, which equals the highest-level of `Classname` spell slot you have." filling in the appropriate class name. This removes the ambiguities around the cantrip level of a non-spellcaster vs a multiclass spellcaster.

### Pages 222-231: 
In the multiclass spellcaster Breadth feats, change "for each spell level other than your two highest spell levels" to "for each spell level other than your two highest `Classname` spell slots." inserting the appropriate class. This makes it clear what to do if you are a spellcaster multiclassing in another spellcasting class (or potentially multiclassing in multiple spellcasting classes).

### Page 630: curses
In curses, add 

> "Effects with this trait can be removed only by effects that specifically target curses." 

This makes it clear that you need to use spells like remove curse to remove a curse, even one put in place by a spell, as opposed to dispel magic. 

### Pages 337, 403, 405: Spells Applying a Curse
In *feeblemind, celestial brand*, and *jealous hex*, make it clear that they are applying a curse.

### Page 634: olfactory trait
Add the olfactory trait from the Bestiary to the Glossary and Index 

> "An olfactory effect can affect only creatures that can smell it. This applies only to olfactory parts of the effect, as determined by the GM." 

### Pages 629–633: Alignments
In the definitions of the chaotic, evil, good, and lawful traits, remove the last sentence. Creatures can use abilities of an alignment without matching that alignment, but they might be anathema or change a creature’s alignment over time with repeated use. 

### Page 637: Summoned trait
In the definition of the summoned trait, add this section to deal with summoned creatures creating more creatures without using summoning 

> "A summoned creature can't control any spawn or other creatures generated from it, and such creatures return to their unaltered state (usually a corpse in the case of spawn) once the summoned creature is gone. If it's unclear what this state would be, the GM decides."

## Pathfinder Core Rulebook Errats Part 3

### Page 113: Champion's Quick Block
The champion's Quick Block feat accidentally had a different name than fighter Quick Shield Block. Change the name to Quick Shield Block to make it clear this is the same feat in two different classes, much like Blind Fight, Quick Draw, or Sudden Charge. 

Additionally, the errata for the 2nd Printing from Blade of Justice correctly removed the restriction making the feat paladin-only but should have still kept a prerequisites of tenets of good. Add that prerequisite back. 

### Pages 118, 130, 204: Wizard Spell Selection
In the wizard, change the spells you can select at 1st level to 

> "You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list (page 307) or from other arcane spells you gain access to. " 

to match the witch.

The cleric and druid are slightly more complicated, as there was some confusion as to how clerics and druids learn new spells (they use Learn a Spell). Change cleric to say they prepare their spells 

> "from the common spells on the divine spell list (page 309) or from other divine spells to which you gain access and learn via Learn a Spell." 

and druid to follow suit. This will cause clerics and druids to have an ever-expanding list of options, so if this becomes unmanageable compared to other prepared spellcasters, consider either restricting to a smaller and more manageable subset of spells like the other prepared spellcasters or implementing strategies like having a few default lists prepared in advance.

### Pages 119-120: Cleric Unarmed Attacks
The 2nd printing errata accidentally missed the cleric when it came to giving expert proficiency in unarmed attacks. Add to both the cloistered cleric and warpriest doctrines that they gain expert proficiency in unarmed attacks in addition to their deity's favored weapon. They still only get the critical specialization effect for their deity's favored weapon.

### Page 151: Knockdown feat
The Knockdown feat's wording made it ambiguous whether you were actually Tripping, which left it uncertain whether you apply any special effects and requirements related to the Trip action. To make it clear, change it to say 

> "If you do and your Strike hits, instead of rolling a check for your Trip attempt, you automatically apply the critical success effect of a Trip."  

### Page 153: Boundless Reprisals
Fighter's Boundless Reprisals should specify you use the reactions for fighter reactions. At the end, add that you can use the extra reactions 

> "for any reaction from a fighter feat or class feature."

### Page 164: Mountain Quake
Monk's Mountain Quake doesn't list which DC to use. While it's technically fine not to include, as class DC is the default for a class feat, given that monks might also have a spell DC, most monk feats indicate that they use class DC. Change to "with a basic Fortitude save against your class DC." 

### Pages 165, 331, 391, 395, 402, 406, 407: Auras
Several auras were missing the aura trait. Add it to monk's 

- Enlightened Presence feat
- divine aura 
- destructive aura
- protector's sphere
- angelic halo
- dread aura
- protective ward spells

### Page 174: Camouflage
The ranger camouflage feat's wording didn't explain what it was meant to do correctly and thus didn't work like camouflage and let you sneak around without any cover or concealment. Change the last sentence to 

> "In natural terrain, you can Hide and Sneak even without cover or being concealed."

### Page 177: Impossible Volley
Ranger's Impossible Volley was missing the flourish and open traits. Add them.

### Page 181: Sneak attack
Rogue's sneak attack accidentally left out ranged unarmed attacks, like leshy's seedpod. Change to 

> "If you Strike a creature that has the flat-footed condition with an agile or finesse melee weapon, an agile or finesse unarmed attack, a ranged weapon attack, or a ranged unarmed attack, you deal an extra 1d6 precision damage. For a ranged attack with a thrown melee weapon, that weapon must also be agile or finesse."

### Page 201: Magic Sense
Sorcerer's Magic Sense should add the trait corresponding to the tradition of spells the sorcerer casts.

### Page 205:  Drain Bonded Item
The Drain Bonded Item is missing language indicating you need to have the item on your person, so add 

> ", as long as the item is on your person." 

to the end of the first sentence.

### Page 214, 217: Animal companions
Animal companions don't technically ever say they are animals, even though some later companions that aren't animals mention they have the "dragon trait instead of the animal trait" for instance. Therefore, change to say 

> "Your animal companion has the animal and minion traits."

Secondly, the nimble animal companion had an error in converting from the playtest and should not have kept a higher proficiency with unarmored defense, which put it roughly 4 AC above other animal companions and in some cases higher than a PC can have. This is a carryover from when proficiency only gave +1 and the savage companion used to have higher proficiency in unarmed attacks while the nimble companion had higher in unarmored defense. Change it so it raises just Acrobatics to expert, putting it back in parallel with savage raising Athletics. This also adjusts Ambusher, Daredevil, and all similar specializations in other books that raise unarmored proficiency: in all those specializations, remove the part where it raises unarmored proficiency to master if the companion was nimble. 

### Page 216: Horse companion
The Horse companion's support benefit mistakenly used the word attack when it meant to use Strike. Change to read 

> "Your horse adds momentum to your charge. Until the start of your next turn, if you moved at least 10 feet on the action before your Strike, add a circumstance bonus to damage for that Strike equal to twice the number of damage dice. If your weapon already has the jousting weapon trait, increase the trait’s damage bonus by 2 per die instead."

### Page 231: wizard multiclass archetype
The wizard multiclass archetype didn't let you pick a school with the dedication, meaning you have to take Arcane School Spell to get some wizard feats, unlike for instance sorcerer, bard, and druid, who choose a bloodline, muse, or order but gain no abilities. Change wizard dedication so you can choose an arcane school but gain no abilities from it. Then in Arcane School Spell, you don't choose a school, and you gain the school spell from the school you already chose.

### Page 247: Lore skill
The Lore skill was ambiguous when addressing inappropriate choices of Lore as to whether those subcategories were allowed. Change to make it clear they are not: 

> "For instance, you couldn't choose Magic Lore to recall the breadth of knowledge about magic covered by Arcana, Nature, Occultism, and Religion, or Adventuring Lore to give you all the information an adventurer needs, or Planar Lore to gain all the information spread across various skills and subcategories such as Heaven Lore."

### Page 266: Scare to Death
Scare to Death's kill chances wound up being too high compared to its action cost and other abilities. Change the critical success to say 

> "The target must attempt at a Fortitude save against your Intimidation DC. On a critical failure, it dies. On any other result, it becomes frightened 2 and is fleeing for 1 round. The critical failure effect has the death trait." 

Then remove the death trait from the feat itself, as creatures immune to death effects can still take the other consequences.

### Pages 301, 634, 637: Minion and summoned traits
The minion and summoned traits are out of date. Change to match _Secrets of Magic_. 

> **Minions** are creatures that directly serve another creature. A creature with this trait can use only 2 actions per turn, doesn’t have reactions, and can’t act when it’s not your turn. Your minion acts on your turn in combat, once per turn, when you spend an action to issue it commands. For an animal companion, you Command an Animal; for a minion that’s a spell or magic item effect, like a summoned minion, you Sustain a Spell or Sustain an Activation; if not otherwise specified, you issue a verbal command as a single action with the auditory and concentrate traits. If given no commands, minions use no actions except to defend themselves or to escape obvious harm. If left unattended for long enough, typically 1 minute, mindless minions usually don’t act, animals follow their instincts, and sapient minions act how they please. A minion can’t control other creatures. 

> A creature called by a spell or effect gains the summoned trait. A summoned creature can’t summon other creatures, create things of value, or cast spells that require a cost. It has the minion trait. If it tries to Cast a Spell of equal or higher level than the spell that summoned it, it overpowers the summoning magic, causing its own spell to fail and the summon spell to end. Otherwise, the summoned creature uses the standard abilities for a creature of its kind. It generally attacks your enemies to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with it, you can attempt to command it, but the GM determines the degree to which it follows your commands.

> Immediately when you finish Casting the Spell, the summoned creature uses its 2 actions for that turn. A spawn or other creature generated from a summoned creature returns to its unaltered state (usually a corpse in the case of spawn) once the summoned creature is gone. If it’s unclear what this state would be, the GM decides. Summoned creatures can be banished by various spells and effects. They are automatically banished if reduced to 0 Hit Points or if the spell that called them ends. 

### Pages 316, 317, 318, 330, 332, 335, 347, 353, 354, 358: Forms
In aerial form, animal form, avatar, dinosaur form, dragon form, elemental form, insect form, monstrosity form, nature incarnate, plant form, change 

> "only attacks you can use" 

to 

> "only attacks you can Strike with." You can still use non-Strike attacks like Grapple and Trip as normal.


### 317, 352, 359, 385: Various Spells
In alter reality, miracle, primal phenomenon, and wish, the spells should be able to automatically duplicate spell slot spells (not rituals or focus spells), and only ones to which you have access in case your group was explicitly restricting access to certain spells for thematic reasons, difficulty of running the spells, or any other reason. Change the first two bullet points to read like the following, with wish as an example:


> "• Duplicate any spell from the arcane list of 9th level or lower to which you have access.  
 • Duplicate any spell from another spell list of 7th level or lower to which you have access."

### Page 324: Chromatic wall
Chromatic wall's blue wall stops sound and correctly indicated that it blocked auditory effects but failed to mention it blocked sonic effects too. Add sonic to the list of effects it blocks. This change also adjusts spells like prismatic wall that depend on chromatic wall.

### Pages 326, 329, 333, 335, 348, 349, 360, 366, 369, 371, 373: 24-Hour Durations
A number of spells accidentally had a duration of 24 hours or 1 day instead of 

> "until the next time you make your daily preparations." 

In general, nearly all beneficial spells should have the latter duration so you can check and keep them active each morning, so that for instance your awesome mansion doesn't vanish and spit out the guests once a day until you make another. These are contingency, dimensional lock, dream message, energy aegis, lock, magnificent mansion, private sanctum, sanctified ground, shrink item, spell immunity, and status.

### Page 330: Disintegrate
Disintegrate technically didn't mention what to do on a hit or miss with the spell attack roll. Add "On a hit" before "you deal 12d10 damage" to make it clear you need to hit.

### Page 340, 369, 562, 574: Ghostly weapon and Shillelagh
In the last errata document, we removed some of the restrictions on spells like magic weapon requiring you cast them on a nonmagical weapon, but we missed a few. In *ghostly weapon* and *shillelagh*, change the target to remove the requirement that it's nonmagical. This requires an extra line in ghostly weapon to explain what happens if you already have the maximum number of property runes for a magical weapon. 

> "If the weapon is magical and already has the maximum number of property runes, the wielder can choose one to suppress to gain ghost touch." 

Then change the items primeval mistletoe and oil of potency as well to remove the restriction, as they mimic effects of these kinds of spells.

### Page 351: meteor swarm
In meteor swarm, there is some ambiguity on how the multiple meteors work when dealing with larger creatures. To make it clear, change the text to say 

> "The meteors’ central 10-foot bursts can’t overlap, and a creature attempts only one saving throw against the spell no matter how many overlapping explosions it's caught in, and they can take each type of damage once once."

### Page 356: Pest form
Pest form has a couple of errors. First, increase the land Speed it grants to 20 feet, as 10 feet is too slow to effectively scout while appearing to be a normal animal. Second, unlike other battle forms, it lacks the text directly explaining what to do about Strikes. Pest form is a 1st level scouting spell and is not meant for attacking, so explicitly change to 

> "While in this form, you gain the animal trait, and you can’t make Strikes." 

### Page 376: synaptic pulse
In synaptic pulse, remove the extraneous range listing, and change the second sentence to say 

> "Each enemy in the area must attempt a Will save." 

to match the first sentence.

### Page 387: Inspire heroics & lingering composition
Both inspire heroics and lingering composition should have the metamagic trait. Add it to both focus spells.

### Page 405: Undeath's Blessing
Undeath's Blessing's Failure effect was inconsistent with the Success effect. The Failure effect (or effect for those who choose to forego the save) should be 

> "For the duration, harm and heal spells treat the creature as undead. In addition, harm spells gain a +2 status bonus to the Hit Points restored to the target." 

### Page 446: non-Strike attack actions
While there are numerous places in the Core Rulebook that indicate that non-Strike attack actions like Shove and Trip take a multiple attack penalty on their checks, in one spot in the definition of multiple attack penalty, it mentions that you take your multiple attack penalty on attack rolls. This caused some confusion as to whether it applies to skill checks or other rolls you might make as part of an attack action despite the other references, so to clear that up, change "attack roll" to "check" in both places.

### Page 451, 621: persistent damage
There are a lot of questions about persistent damage. Check the CRB FAQ for more information, but the one thing that we're adding in errata is explicitly stating 

> "Like normal damage, it can be doubled or halved based on the results of an attack roll or saving throw."

### Page 476: Flanking
Flanking was ambiguous on what happened if you made a ranged attack while within reach of a foe you are flanking. To make it clear that only melee attacks benefit from flanking, change the second sentence to read 

> "A creature is flat-footed (taking a –2 circumstance penalty to AC) to melee attacks from creatures that are flanking it."

### Page 500: Assurance & Downtime
Since people have been specifically asking about Assurance with respect to downtime, after 

> "If something could apply constantly, or so often that it might as well be constant, it’s more likely to be used for downtime checks;" 

we added 

> "for instance Assurance could apply." 

to show that it's something that could apply constantly.

### Page 557: Electric eelskin
Electric eelskin armor accidentally listed a spell DC for shocking grasp and not a spell attack modifier. It should have a spell attack modifier of +19.

### Page 557, 600: Specific magic armor and weapons
Specific magic armor and weapons say you can't etch a property rune, but you also can't remove a property rune or transfer a property rune to or from a specific armor or weapon. Explicitly add those restrictions to the definitions of each.

### Page 565: Affixing a Talisman
The intro to Affixing a Talisman said you can't affix more than one talisman to the same item, which is slightly incorrect. Change it to match the Affix a Talisman action just below, which says you can, but you just deactivate them all so it's usually a bad idea. 

### Pages 565, 597: Spells to Craft Items
You only need to learn a single 1st level formula to Craft any scroll or any magic wand (though specialty wands each require their own formulas as normal). Add 

> "You only need to learn one 1st-level formula to Craft a magic wand." 

and parallel text for scrolls.

### Page 585: Wounding rune
In the wounding rune, given that persistent damage doubles on a critical hit, changing the 1d6 to 1d12 instead of doubling would actually make it deal less damage on average. Thus, remove the part about changing to 1d12 damage on a critical hit. Instead, the wounding rune's bleed damage doubles as normal for persistent damage.

### Page 588: Reflecting shield
Reflecting shield's counteract modifier had a typo listing it at +40. It should be +30.

### Page 614: 
The ring of lies was erroneously missing its frequency entry for the activation. It should be once per day, as per the usual guidelines for a spell activation in an item.

### Page 614: Greater ring of maniacal devices
The greater ring of maniacal devices has a price that is drastically incorrect for a level 18 item. It should be 21,000 gp. The incorrect price is also listed in the treasure tables.

### Page 616: Robe of the archmagi's color scheme
Replace robe of the archmagi's color scheme with a more in-world pattern using gold for good, red for evil, and light blue for neutral. This scheme is patterned after gold dragons (the strongest metallic dragon), red dragons (the strongest chromatic dragon), and cloud dragons (the strongest, and all true neutral primal dragon) respectively.

## Pathfinder Core Rulebook Errata Part 4

### Page 26: Ancestry ability boosts

We're making a significant change to how ancestry ability boosts work. The purpose of this is to better reflect diversity within each ancestry and to allow for greater freedom in creating characters. Though you can still choose the ability boosts listed in each ancestry, every character has a new alternative option.

#### Alternative Ability Boosts

The ability boosts and flaws listed in each ancestry represent general trends or help guide players to create the kinds of characters from that ancestry most likely to pursue the life of an adventurer. However, ancestries aren’t a monolith. You always have the option to replace your ancestry’s listed ability boosts and ability flaws entirely and instead select two free ability boosts when creating your character.

The text above is an alternative open to all characters, not an optional rule. Voluntary flaws remains an optional rule. Due to many of its advantages being supplanted by the rule above, we've made some adjustments to voluntary flaws to make them purely a roleplaying choice.

#### Optional: Voluntary Flaws

Sometimes, it’s fun to play a character with a major flaw regardless of your ancestry. You can elect to take additional ability flaws when applying the ability boosts and ability flaws from your ancestry. This is purely for roleplaying a highly flawed character, and you should consult with the rest of your group if you plan to do this! You can’t apply more than one flaw to any single ability score.

### Pages 65, 131, 133, 135, 136, 336, 354, 370, 410, 595: Plants and fungi

Multiple rules that should work with both plants and fungi currently work with only plants, and these changes make them work the way they’re intended. Note that this isn’t a universal change! Some rules, like plant form, plant growth, and blight, still apply only to plants. The following rules should work with both plants and fungi.

- **Sylvan (Page 65)**: The Sylvan language in the table should list plant and fungus creatures.
- **Leaf Order (Page 131)**: The anathema apply to fungi.
- **Leshy Familiar (Page 133)**: Your familiar is a fungus if you choose a fungus leshy.
- **Woodland Stride (Page 135)**: You get the same benefits moving through fungi.
- **Green Empathy (Page 136)**: You can communicate with fungi in the same way as with plants.
- **Entangle (Page 336)**: The area is “all squares in a 20-foot burst that contain plants or fungi”.
- **Nature’s Enmity (Page 354)**: Fungi hate them too!
- **Speak with Plants (Page 370)**: You can speak with fungi in the same way as plants.
- **Commune with Nature (Page 410)**: They know about fungi too.
- **Verdant Staff (Page 595)**: It helps you identify fungi too. We’ve also changed it from Nature checks to checks in general, so you can use it with relevant Lore skills, such as Herbalism Lore.

#### Page 72Quick Alchemy

Change Quick Alchemy’s text to say 

> “You create a single alchemical consumable item…” 

instead of 

> “You create a single alchemical item…” 

This wording is more precise, and works correctly with non-consumable alchemical items.

### Page 73–76

The alchemist is getting multiple changes to allow for more choice and allow options from books outside the Core Rulebook. These boost all the fields in the books somewhat, with some additional spice for the chirurgeon.

- **Research Field (page 73)**: The chirurgeon can now choose two common 1st-level elixirs with the healing trait to add to their formula book. In addition, they can substitute Crafting for Medicine in a broader scope, as follows.
  > "You can use your proficiency rank in Crafting for anything that requires a proficiency rank in Medicine (such as prerequisites), and use your Crafting modifier in place of your Medicine modifier for all Medicine checks."
- **Field Discovery (page 74)**: The chirurgeon gets the three-elixir benefit to make any elixir with the healing trait, not just elixirs of life.
- **Perpetual Infusions (page 75)**: All of these have changed somewhat to offer a broader selection. In addition, due to changes to perpetual potency and perpetual perfection, there's a new sentence here: "Each time you gain a level, you can swap any number of your perpetual infusions with other eligible infusions." 
    - **"Bomber**: Choose two 1st-level bombs.
    - **"Chirurgeon**: Choose two 1st-level elixirs with the healing trait. If a creature heals Hit Points from a perpetual infusion, that creature is temporarily immune to healing Hit Points from subsequent perpetual infusions for 10 minutes (but not immune to any other effects of those infusions).
    - **"Mutagenist**: Choose two 1st-level mutagens."

The chirurgeon required a special rule for elixirs that heal HP to work correctly alongside healing resources across the game. Giving everyone in your party a perpetual infusion elixir of life when you stop for a rest will still work, but you don't get much benefit from doling out 300 of them in that 10 minutes. Note that can still choose to spend reagents when creating an elixir to heal a creature that has temporary immunity to perpetual infusions! 

Note that, unlike the toxicologist in Advanced Player's Guide, these don't restrict you to only common items, since those restrictions are already a part of adding formulas to your formula book. If you've gained access to an non-common alchemical item that fits the other restrictions, you can choose it for a perpetual infusion. We will consider changing the toxicologist when we next set our gaze on that book.

Since this is likely to become a FAQ given some of the perpetual infusions changes, remember that perpetual infusions remove only the reagent cost for Quick Alchemy. You would still need to spend extra batches of infused reagents to Combine Elixirs with a perpetual infusion, for example.

**Perpetual Potency (page 75)**

The choices you can make are more broad, and you no longer need to upgrade your choices from perpetual infusions (hence the ability to swap out your perpetual infusions when you level up, so you can upgrade your favorite item if you like). The levels are different between research fields to maintain the intended balance while still allowing the options from previous printings of the Core Rulebook.

- **"Bomber: Choose two 3rd-level or lower bombs.
- **"Chirurgeon**: Choose two 6th level or lower elixirs with the healing trait.
- **"Mutagenist**: Choose two 3rd level or lower mutagens."
- **Perpetual Perfection (page 76)**: These changes are similar to perpetual potency's, but did not require the - **same level restrictions.
    - **"Bomber**: Choose two 11th-level or lower bombs.
    - **"Chirurgeon**: Choose two 11th-level or lower elixirs with the healing trait.
    - **"Mutagenist**: Choose two 11th-level or lower mutagens."

### Page 113: Champion's Quick Shield Block

The champion's Quick Shield Block feat received incomplete errata in the 3rd printing. Add 

> "Prerequisites Shield Block"

The fighter's Quick Shield Block feat has also been changed to have the same prerequisites.

### Pages 119–120: Cleric simple weapon proficiency

The cleric’s original proficiency put their simple weapon proficiency behind spellcasters who aren’t good with weapons, like the sorcerer. Make the following changes.

- **Cloistered Cleric (Page 119)**: Fourth Doctrine grants expert proficiency with your deity’s favored weapon, simple weapons, and unarmed attacks.
- **Warpriest (Page 120)**: Third doctrine grants expert proficiency with your deity’s favored weapon, simple weapons, and unarmed attacks.

### Page 120: Warpriest's first doctrine

The warpriest's first doctrine wasn't as clear as it could be that you do gain Deadly Simplicity if your deity's favored weapon is an unarmed attack, so the text has been updated.

### Page 149: fighter Quick Shield Block

The fighter Quick Shield Block feat should match the champion's, so we've made the prerequisites less strenuous. The updated entry is 

> "**Prerequisites** Shield Block".

### Page 184: Minor Magic

The rogue Minor Magic feat was unclear on whether the spells are innate spells or made you a spellcaster. We've amended the text to note that you gain the Cast a Spell activity. These spells work similarly to the ones you get from multiclass dedication feats for spellcasting classes. However, you don't gain a spell repertoire, spellbook, or similar, so your oddball rogue magic doesn't let you use abilities that require those.

### Pages 198 and 209: Counterspell

The Counterspell feat used "disrupt" to describe generally what the feat is doing, but this has caused confusion with the rules for disrupting actions. Change the text to "counter" instead. The feat counteracts the spell; it doesn't disrupt it.

### Page 216: Horse Support Benefit

The horse's support benefit had issues, even with the 3rd printing errata. It was meant to be for dealing more damage on a charge, but allowing for unintended maneuvers like getting the bonus while flanking with your horse or shooting a bow. Here's the new text of the horse's support benefit.

> **Support Benefit** Until the start of your next turn, if you’re mounted on your horse and moved 10 feet or more on the action before a melee Strike, add a circumstance bonus to damage for that Strike equal to twice the number of weapon damage dice. If your weapon already has the jousting weapon trait, increase the trait’s damage bonus by 2 per die instead. 

### Page 281: Flickmace

The gnome flickmace was too strong due to the inherent advantages of a one-handed reach weapon. It’s been changed to reduce its damage die and Bulk and add sweep so it functions more like a flail.

Gnome flickmace statistics are as follows.

> **Price** 3 gp; **Damage** 1d6 B; **Bulk** 1; **Hands** 1; **Group** Flail; **Weapon Traits** Gnome, reach, sweep

### Page 287 & 293: Basic crafter’s book

The formulas in a basic crafter’s book didn’t match in two different locations the book was described. Page 293 was correct: A basic crafter’s book includes all 0-level common items in the Equipment chapter, not all common items in the chapter.

### Page 288: Hands & Tools

We’ve changed the Hands entries for sets of tools to in the Adventuring Gear table to “1 or 2” with a footnote, to indicate you can use them with 1 hand if you’re wearing them. The affected tool sets are, for reference: 

- alchemist’s tools
- artisan’s tools
- sterling artisan’s tools
- healer’s tools
- expanded healer’s tools
- thieves tools
- infiltrator thieves' tools

### Page 302: Innate Spells & Cast a Spell

It was unclear how innate spells work with the Cast a Spell activity and whether they make you a spellcaster. They work much like non-spellcasters with focus spells. Here’s the adjusted text that now appears in the first paragraph, including the component info moved from a different paragraph.

> “You gain the ability to Cast a Spell and use any spellcasting actions necessary to cast your innate spells; since this magic is innate, you can replace any material component with a somatic component (page 303). Innate spells don’t let you qualify for abilities that require you to be a spellcaster.”

### Pages 317, 352, 359, 385: alter reality, miracle, primal phenomenon, and wish

The 3rd printing errata to alter reality, miracle, primal phenomenon, and wish inadvertently restricted spells you could choose from other spell lists too much. Because you typically don’t have any access to spells not on your spell list, the option to cast a spell “to which you have access” from another list was useless for most characters. The new text is as follows for all four spells: 

> “• Duplicate any spell from another spell list of 7th level or lower. It must be common or you must have access.”

### Page 319–320: avatar

In the avatar spell, change “bull rush” in Gozreh and Torag to “shove”.

### Page 329–330: tyrannosaurus battle form

The tyrannosaurus battle form or dinosaur form didn’t list a die size for the deadly trait on its jaws Strike. It should be deadly d12.

### Page 369: silence

The description of silence erroneously mentioned “other senses,” which could suggest it prevents creatures from noticing the target using sight, tremorsense, or other senses. The spell should read, 

> "The target makes no sound, preventing creatures from noticing it using hearing alone."

### Page 370: Soothe and non-Living

The soothe spell can now target 

> “1 willing creature” instead of “1 willing living creature”. It can be used to heal undead, constructs, and so on."

(This change matches the rules noted in Book of the Dead and Blood Lords Player’s Guide.) Note that it has the mental trait, so it still doesn’t heal or otherwise benefit mindless creatures like zombies or animated objects.

### Page 383: Wall of Stone/Thorns

Wall of stone and wall of thorns have a mismatch with some other walls. Their walls can now be destroyed in 10-foot-by-10-foot sections instead of 5-foot-by-5-foot sections.

### Page 399: Word of freedom

The word of freedom domain spell can suppress the restrained condition in addition to the other conditions listed, and the sentence about suppressing the grabbed condition should include the restrained condition.

### Page 460, 462, 469: Gaining and Losing actions

The text on Gaining and Losing actions on page 462 and for the last step of starting your turn on page 469 indicated that if you had a condition that said “you can’t act,” you wouldn’t regain any actions on your turn, rather than merely being unable to use them. This conflicted with the sidebar on page 622, which was correct. Conditions and other effects that cause you to change the number of actions you regain (such as quickened, slowed, or stunned) say so.

The text under Death on page 460 has been amended slightly to say you lose all your actions while dead so it works as intended.

### Page 465: Detecting with Other Senses

Many abilities use shorthand like “a creature you can see.” These abilities typically work just fine with other precise senses, so the Detecting with Other Senses sidebar was adjusted to note this. Examples include using a precise sense (like echolocation for precise hearing) for the Coerce activity of the Intimidation skill, an investigator’s Devise a Stratagem action, and the thaumaturge’s Exploit Vulnerability action.

### Page 555: Elven chain

Elven chain didn’t include the adjustment to its Bulk from being made of mithral, and should be light Bulk instead of 1 Bulk. (It also repeated the +2 item bonus to AC unnecessarily; this is the same as any chain shirt.) To summarize, the differences between elven chain and a mithral chain shirt are that elven chain has no check penalty and no noisy trait.

### Page 570: Dust of disappearance

Dust of disappearance now has the uncommon trait, just like invisibility potion.

### Page 571: Holy/Unholy water

Add the necromancy trait to holy water and unholy water.

### Page 580: Runes

The runes section was not entirely clear that you do need to be able to craft magic items (with the Magical Crafting feat, typically) to etch or transfer runes.

### Page 588: Spellguard Shield

Spellguard shield should allow you to Shield Block in the way the a dragonslayer’s shield or the Reflexive Shield feat do. At the end of the description, add to the final sentence, 

> “and you can Shield Block spells that target you if you have that action.”

### Page 595: Verdant staff

Verdant staff, as noted in another correction, now helps you identify fungi as well as plants. In case you skipped that entry because you don't care about fungi, note that we've also changed it from applying to only Nature checks to checks in general, so you get help identifying plants and fungi with relevant Lore skills, such as Herbalism Lore.

## Pathfinder Core Rulebook Clarifications (4th Printing)

### Page 264 

> When I use Natural Medicine, can I attempt the higher-DC checks even though I'm not using Medicine?

You absolutely can. Essentially, you replace any mention of “Medicine” in the activity with “Nature” if you’re using Natural Medicine. You do still need healer’s tools. 

Also, note that this feat applies only to using Treat Wounds. You would still need to be an expert in Medicine, not Nature, to select the Ward Medic feat. If you did qualify for and did select Ward Medic, you would be able to use Nature to Treat Wounds for two targets. You’d still need to become a master or legendary in Medicine to treat more targets than that.

### Pages 266 

> Can I use Shield Block if I take physical damage that didn't come from an attack?

Shield Block can only be used against physical damage from attacks, since non-attack effects can't trigger the Shield Block. For instance, if you walk over a square of hazardous terrain that deals piercing damage to you, having your shield raised doesn't help you, nor does it help if you need to make a Reflex save against a spell that deals bludgeoning damage. Some abilities let you use Shield Block with other triggers, as seen in the shield spell and the fighter's Reflexive Shield feat, but these exceptions are noted. Also note the 4th printing errata to spellguard shield (page 588) allows it to apply in this way.

### Pages 279–280 

> If I hold a weapon that requires 1 hand in 2 hands, is it a 2-handed weapon?

**There are two answers to this.**

For abilities that count the number of hands for a weapon while you're using it, such as an action with "Requirements You are wielding a one-handed melee weapon," count the actual number of hands you're using at the time. If you're holding a bastard sword in two hands, you couldn't use it with that ability. Weapons with the "1+" notation in their description, such as most bows, use both your hands when shooting, but leave you with a hand free for other actions the rest of the time.

Anything that's an intrinsic part of the weapon, such as a shifting rune, works differently. Reference the weapon's "Hands" entry in the weapons table—a bastard sword requires 1 hand, even though it gets a benefit in two hands from the two-hand trait. If you were holding a shifting bastard sword in two hands and activated it, you could turn it into a longsword (which you'd still be holding in two hands), but couldn't turn it into a greatsword (which requires 2 hands). For this purpose, "1" and "1+" are the same (though this doesn't matter for shifting since "1+" appears ranged weapons).

### Page 283: 

> What do I need to do to switch how many hands I'm using for a jousting weapon?

If you want to use a jousting weapon one-handed while on a mount, you can make this decision as part of taking your Mount action. After that, changing hands takes the same actions described on page 271 under Carrying and Using Items. If you dismount while wielding a jousting weapon one-handed, you can either switch to using two hands as part of that action if you have a hand free at that point. If not, you'll still be holding the weapon in one hand, but not able to wield it. You'll have to free up a hand and Interact to wield the jousting weapon while not mounted.

### Pages 301 and 634: 

> Can a minion be quickened or slowed? 

Yes. This can be a bit unclear because those conditions apply “at the start of your turn” and a minion can’t typically act until you use an action. Apply these conditions and any other effects that alter a minion’s number of actions when the minion gains its actions, using 2 actions and 0 reactions as the minion’s starting number. Though a minion can’t normally act when it’s not your turn, abilities that specifically grant a minion a reaction provide an exception to this (such as the Ferocious Beasts orc ancestry feat, Advanced Players Guide page 19).

### Page 451: 

> How do extra critical effects work on a creature immune to critical hits?

Immunity to critical hits reads “When a creature immune to critical hits is critically hit by a Strike or other attack that deals damage, it takes normal damage instead of double damage.” This means what it says: The attack deals normal damage instead of double damage. Other effects specific to a critical hit still occur, such as critical specialization effects and extra damage dice from traits like deadly and fatal. You also still have the option to use abilities that trigger on critical hits, like the vorpal rune’s reaction (though many creatures immune to crits also don’t need heads to live, lucky devils). Your GM can still say no to extremely strange consequences of this rule on a case-by-case basis.

### Page 458

> If an affliction makes me enfeebled 1 without listing a duration and the affliction ends, am I enfeebled forever? 

The rules on Conditions from Afflictions note that a condition can last for a longer duration that the affliction that caused it, using drained as an example. There are three categories of effects from afflictions here.

1. Immediate effects like damage happen as soon as you reach the stage.
1. Conditions that have a way to end them by default last for their normal duration. This includes conditions like drained, frightened, persistent damage, and sickened.
1. Conditions that always need to include a duration because they don’t have a normal way to recover from them—such as clumsy or paralyzed—last as long as the stage of the affliction on which they appear. This also applies to effects that are ongoing but specific to the affliction rather than being defined conditions, such as a penalty to certain rolls.

### Page 475: 

> How do I adjudicate forced movement if a creature makes another creature move with it?

Creatures like elephants and rocs can move while taking a grabbed creature with them. The rules on page 475 say “Usually the creature or effect forcing the movement chooses the path the victim takes. If you’re pushed or pulled, you can usually be moved through hazardous terrain, pushed off a ledge, or the like. Abilities that reposition you in some other way can’t put you in such dangerous places unless they specify otherwise. In all cases, the GM makes the final call if there’s doubt on where forced movement can move a creature.”

So can you summon an elephant and have it run alongside a wall of fire and drag a creature in its trunk through every square of the wall? Generally, no. The point is that the victim is being carried with the creature. However, the GM can make other calls within reason calls here. For instance, if the elephant moves through that wall of fire, it’s likely it and the creature both take the damage.

### Page 585 

> What can a shifting rune change a weapon into?

This repeats some information from the clarification on one-handed versus two-handed weapons. 

Because a shifting rune is based on the attributes of the weapon it's etched to, reference the weapon's "Hands" entry in the weapons table to see what it can turn into. A bastard sword requires 1 hand, even though it gets a benefit in two hand from the two-hand trait. If you were holding a shifting bastard sword in two hands and activated it, you could turn it into a longsword (which you'd still be holding in two hands), but couldn't turn it into a greatsword (which requires 2 hands).

So what if the weapon has the jousting trait, normally requiring two hands, but you're wielding it in one hand because you're on a mount? You can activate shifting to turn it into a different weapon that requires 2 hands and has the jousting trait and continue as you are, or you can turn it into a weapon that requires 2 hands and doesn't have the jousting trait. If you do that, you're still holding it in one hand, but can't wield it unless you free up another hand and Interact to change how you're holding it.
One further note: The shifting rune can change the Bulk of the weapon, but you can't, for example, turn an adamantine shifting weapon of light Bulk into a weapon of 1 Bulk and sell the adamantine. You would use the base form, not the form magic has turned it into.

### Page 592 

> How can I use a staff if I have high-level slots but not lower ones?

Classes like the magus and summoner lose their lower-level slots as they go up in level, but can still cast lower-level spells from staves. In other words, a spellcaster who has 2nd- and 3rd-level slots but not 1st-level slots can still cast a 1st-level spell from a staff. (A magus who prepares a staff still has to sacrifice a spell slot they actually have if they want to add extra charges, though.)

### Page 621 

> How can I tell which multiple persistent damage value is higher when it's not obvious?

Multiple Persistent Damage Conditions notes that you keep only the highest amount of persistent damage. How do you choose between 3 persistent fire damage and 1d6 persistent fire damage (which is usually, but not always higher)? In these cases, the GM should quickly use their best guess to decide which applies. Don’t worry about doing all the math of average damage, just follow your heart to which seems most severe.

## Advanced Player's Guide Errata

### Page 23: Rat Magic feat

The Rat Magic feat in ratfolk was missing the ratfolk trait. Add the trait.

### Pages 38, 42, 44: ancestry feats with uncommon spells

A few ancestry feats with uncommon spells were erroneously not listed as uncommon. These are 

- duskwalker's Boneyard' Call
- dwarf's Stonegate
- gnome's Homeward Bound

### Page 45: Kneecap feat
The Kneecap feat doesn't list the duration of the penalty. It lasts for 1 round.

### Page 74: flame augur sample
The flame augur sample character had *burning hands* before level 4, when they would have been able to take Divine Access. Change it to *fear*.

### Pages 80, 104, 105, 257: your highest level spell
Several places mentioned "your highest level spell" when they should have mentioned "your highest level spell slot." This includes the witch feat Siphon Power, the Quickened Casting feat in both oracle and witch (which standardizes it with the same change in the Core Rulebook Quickened Casting feats) and candle of invocation.

### Page 95: witch initial proficiencies
In witch initial proficiencies, the spell proficiencies say the tradition of magic is determined by the witch's first lesson, but that's a holdover from the playtest. It should say the tradition is determined by the witch's patron.

### Page 101: Witch's Widen Spell
Witch's Widen Spell accidentally had the concentrate trait instead of manipulate like everyone else. Change it to manipulate.

### Page 111: Sunder Spell
In Sunder Spell, there's no guidance on what it takes to hit something like a wall that doesn't have a listed AC. Add 

> “If you're targeting something that doesn't have an AC listed, its AC is usually 10 against this Strike for targets that are very easy to hit, like a wall, or a different AC determined by the GM.”

### Page 146: independent familiar
There's been some confusion over whether an independent familiar can use abilities that require a command, like valet, or whether the independent ability overrides the normal rules for mounted combat. To make clear that neither is the case, add 

> "This doesn’t work with valet or similar abilities that require a command, if you’re capable of riding your familiar, or similar situations."

### Page 161: Beastmaster's
Beastmaster's Call was missing its school. It should be conjuration.

### Page 163: Keep Pace
In bounty hunter's Keep Pace, in the first sentence, the word "escape" should not be capitalized. It's just talking about escaping in general, not the Escape action.

### Pages 161 and 193: archetype focus spells
The archetype focus spells should be uncommon. This includes:

- beastmaster's beastmaster's trance spell
- shadowdancer's dance of darkness, shadow illusion, and shadow jump spells

### Page 168-169: Dragon disciple
Dragon disciple has a couple errors. 

First, the dedication feat should make you trained in arcane spell DCs and spell attack rolls, in case you need that training when picking up the later feats that give you arcane focus spells. 

Second, the armor bonus from Scales of the Dragon feat should change to match the errata to Animal Skin and Mountain Stance in the Core Rulebook. The final text of that section is as follows: 

> "When you’re unarmored, the scales give you a +2 item bonus to AC with a Dexterity cap of +3. The item bonus to AC from Scales of the Dragon is cumulative with armor potency runes on your explorer's clothing, mage armor, and bracers of armor."

### Page 172: Cantrips via Dedication and Spellcaster Allotments
Remove the paragraph from the first printing that begins, 

> "If you already cast spells from spell slots, you gain one additional cantrip from that tradition." 

If you're already a spellcaster, you use your normal allotment of spells for eldritch archer abilities and don't gain more spells.

### Page 191: Sentinel Archetype
Sentinel Archetype's Armor Specialist feat had a stray Skill trait due to an error. Remove it.

### Page 208: Contacts feat
The Contacts feat incorrectly refers to Underworld Connections, which is the old name of the feat Criminal Connections. Replace with the correct name.

### Page 214, 222, 223, 228, 232, 237: Sustained Spell Effects
Animated assault, mad monkeys, quench, hymn of healing, interstellar void, and steal shadow all need to say their effects occur 

> "The first time each round you Sustain the Spell" 

due to clarifications in the Core Rulebook on Sustaining spells. Meanwhile, aqueous orb is in the opposite situation because it was meant to allow effects from multiple Sustains already. Remove 

> "Unlike most spells"

### Page 220-221: Ice & Lightning Storms 
Ice storm and lightning storm had some issues, with potentially-intense effects limited to a way-too-small area. The big change was that they both updated the area from 5-foot radius to 20-foot radius, but there's a few adjustments to keep them on track with other similar spells with the new area. The full adjusted text is as follows:

> **Ice Storm Spell 4**      
    Cold Evocation    
    Traditions arcane, primal    
    Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal    
    Range 120 feet; Area 20-foot burst    
    Saving Throw basic Reflex; Duration sustained up to 1 minute    
    You create a gray storm cloud that pelts creatures with an icy deluge. When you Cast the Spell, a burst of magical hail deals 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 2d8 cold damage to each creature in the area below the cloud (basic Reflex save). Snow and sleet continue to rain down in the area for the remainder of the spell’s duration, making the area difficult terrain. Any creature that ends its turn in the storm takes 2 cold damage. If you Cast this Spell outdoors, you can create two non-overlapping clouds instead of one. As normal, if a big creature is in both clouds, it still only takes the initial damage once and the continuing damage once per turn.    
    **Heightened** (+2) The initial bludgeoning damage and cold damage increase by 1d8 each, and the cold damage creatures take at the end of their turns increases by 1.    

> ****Lightning Storm Spell 5**     
    Electricity Evocation    
    Traditions primal    
    Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal    
    Range 120 feet; Area 20-foot burst    
    Saving Throw basic Reflex; Duration sustained up to 1 minute    
    You create a black, rumbling storm cloud and call down one lightning bolt within the spell’s area. The bolt is a vertical line from the top of the storm cloud to the ground below, dealing 4d12 electricity damage to creatures in the line (basic Reflex save). On subsequent rounds, the first time you Sustain the Spell each round, you can call another lightning bolt within the area. If you Cast this Spell outdoors, you can create two non-overlapping clouds instead of one, though you can still call down only one bolt per turn.     
    Heightened (+2) The damage of each bolt increases by 1d12.    


### Page 226: Threefold Aspect
Threefold Aspect is missing its components. It should have material, somatic, and verbal components.

### Page 230: Ancestral form
Ancestral form says you can "Sustain a Spell" but should say you can "Sustain Spells" to make it clearer that you are not limited to Sustaining a single spell.

### Page 233: Tempest form
Tempest form prevents you from using manipulate actions but then offers several you can do. Add "except those granted by this spell" to the restriction on manipulate actions.

### Page 234: Heal companion
Heal companion's 2-action version was missing the somatic component. It should have both somatic and verbal components.

### Page 248: Ranged weapons
The ranged weapons had slight errors in their table entries. The bola should be an uncommon weapon. Meanwhile, the daikyu should have reload 0 (not --) and should be propulsive.

### Page 249: Detective's
Detective's Kit, like the Core Rulebook kits, should need 1 hand if you're wearing it and 2 otherwise. Change to match Core Rulebook.

### Page 250: Walking cauldron
The table erroneously lists the walking cauldron as a held item, but it isn't in its entry. It should be "Other." 

### Page 255: Timeless salts
Timeless salts mentions the non-existing spell speak with dead, but it should say talking corpse instead.

### Page 265: Wand of hopeless night
Wand of hopeless night's 4th-level spell type should increase the DC to 27.

### Page 266: Curse trait
Update the curse trait to match the newest version in the Core Rulebook. 

> "curse (trait) A curse is an effect that places some long-term affliction on a creature. Curses are always magical and are typically the result of a spell or trap. Effects with this trait can be removed only by effects that specifically target curses. 457–458"

### Page 268-270: Minion and summoned traits
As mentioned in the Bestiary 2 errata, there were some small changes to the minion and summoned traits to better handle situations where minions might get control of more creatures and create a cascade. In the minion trait, at the end add 

> "A minion can’t control other creatures." 

In the summoned trait, remove the specification that the spell summoning them must be conjuration (as some necromancy spells summon creatures, for instance), and remove the sentence saying they can't control any spawn they create, since the minion trait now already includes that restriction and it's redundant to include it again in summoned.

## Pathfinder Bestiary 2 Errata

### Page 19: Ankou
In the ankou's skills, change Bluff to Deception.

### Page 34: Basidirond’s
The basidirond’s hallucinogenic cloud is missing all its traits. These should be incapacitation, mental, and poison.

### Page 57: Culdewen
The culdewen should be uncommon, and several abilities didn't work quite right, making it unnecessarily difficult for PCs to escape the culdewen's hook. Add the uncommon trait. In Hooked, change  

> “The fish hook can be removed only if a creature spends an Interact action and succeeds at a DC 25 Athletics check to pull it free.” 

to 

> “The fish hook can be removed if a creature Escapes (DC 25), pulling it free." 

In Land the Fish, after 

> “On a success, the creature is restrained by the culdewen.” 

add 

> “Escaping from the restrained condition (DC 25) also allows a creature to remove the hook.

### Page 61: Thanadaemon
Change the thanadaemon's Focus Gaze’s effect to say 

> “The thanadaemon glares at a single creature they can see within 30 feet. If the target wasn’t already frightened, they must immediately attempt a DC 33 Will save against the thanadaemon's terrifying gaze. If the target was already frightened, they must attempt a DC 33 Will save or become fleeing for 1d4 rounds; this second effect has the incapacitation trait. After attempting its save, the creature is temporarily immune to this ability until the start of the thanadaemon's next turn.”

### Page 70: Denizen of Leng
Add the uncommon trait to the Denizen of Leng.

### Page 93: Giant Cockroach
The Giant Cockroach Swarm is listed as Small, but should be Large

### Page 99: Drainberry Bush
The drainberry bush should have been listed as uncommon. Add the uncommon trait.

### Page 184: Followers of fate
The followers of fate religion should have the 3rd level spell threefold aspect instead of the 2nd level spell web.

### Page 241: Skaveling
The skaveling is missing its undead immunities. Add 

> “Immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, unconscious.”

### Page 248: Specter's Spectral Corruption
The specter's Spectral Corruption ability, especially when combined with high attack and damage, make it an oversized threat for a level 7 monster. 

Replace it with:

> **Spectral Corruption [two-actions]** (curse, divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental)  
The specter makes a vile touch Strike. If it damages a living creature, the specter gains 5 temporary Hit Points and the target creature must attempt a DC 24 Will save to avoid becoming corrupted.  
_Critical Success_ The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune to spectral corruption for 1 minute.  
_Success_ The creature is stupefied 2 for 1 hour.  
_Failure_ The creature succumbs to the corruption and becomes a spectral thrall temporarily. The creature is controlled by the specter, obeying the specter's telepathic or spoken orders, though a spectral thrall does not obey obviously self-destructive orders. This lasts until the end of the thrall’s next turn, at which point it is no longer controlled but becomes stupefied 2 for 1 hour.   
_Critical Failure_ As failure, but the duration is unlimited. The thrall can attempt a new Will save at the end of each of its turns; on a success, it is no longer controlled by the specter but becomes stupefied 2 for 1 hour.   

- Change the vile touch Strike to “vile touch +16 (finesse), Damage 2d8+8 negative.” Note that this also cuts "plus spectral corruption" from the Strike, since it needs to use the Spectral Corruption activity to get the full effect.
- As a note for summoning specters, an upcoming erratum to the minion trait in the Core Rulebook will clarify that minions can't control other creatures, which means summoned specters can't control other creatures with Spectral Corruption.

### Page 249: Spiders' bite attacks
Both spiders' bite attacks should be "fangs" attacks. They are also missing their damage type, which should be piercing.

### Page 255: Stygira
Add the uncommon trait to the stygira.

### Page 260: Giant tick
The giant tick has an enfeebled entry with no value. In tick fever, in the first stage, after enfeebled add “1”.

### Page 266: Two-Headed Troll
The Two-Headed Troll's Reactive Chomp doesn't work quite right. Change it from a single action to a reaction. 

Replace its Requirements entry with 

> **Trigger** On one head's initiative, the troll hits the same enemy with two consecutive claw Strikes in the same round
- and change the effect to 
> While the prey is distracted with unrelenting claw attacks, the head that's not taking its turn makes a jaws Strike against the enemy.

### Page 267: Jotund troll
Jotund troll’s jaws Strike should have the Grab ability, so it can use its other abilities that happen when it Grabs creatures with its jaws.

### Page 281: Ostiarius
Add the incapacitation trait to the ostiarius's Focus Gaze ability.

### Page 286: Violet venom 
Add the uncommon trait to the violet venom item.

### Page 290-291: Moon Frenzy 
Moon Frenzy should say 

> "jaws Strike (or a similar Strike)" 

so that wereboar can use it. Additionally, the curse DCs are slightly off. Change wereboar's DC to 15 and weretiger's DC to 18.

### Page 300: Yellow musk creeper
The yellow musk creeper's Spray Pollen is missing some of its information. 

- First, it should have the incapacitation trait.
- Second, change the failure and critical failure entries to:  

    > **Failure** The creature is fascinated. For as long as it is fascinated, it must spend each of its actions to move closer to the yellow musk creeper as expediently as possible, while avoiding obvious dangers. If the creature is adjacent to the yellow musk creeper, it stays still and doesn't act. If anyone takes a hostile action against the creature or its allies, the effect ends. Otherwise, the creature can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the effects end.   
    **Critical Failure** As failure, but the condition doesn't end automatically if anyone takes a hostile action against the creature or its allies.

### Page 301: Yellow musk vial
Add the uncommon trait to the yellow musk vial.

## Lost Omens Character Guide Errata

### Page 25: Ancient elf heritage
The ancient elf heritage is lacking guidance about an appropriate age for the heritage. After the heritage's first sentence, add 

> "A typical ancient elf is at least 100 years old, though you might be younger at the GM’s discretion." 

As the heritage is based on an elf's biological lifespan, it is an example of the type of heritage that a half-elf can't take.

### Page 33: Eclectic Obsession
Eclectic Obsession is missing an action/activity symbol. The feat requires one action.

The Hobgoblin Weapon Familiarity feat was granting training in too many weapons for a single feat. Change the feat's first sentence to 

> "You are trained with composite longbows, composite shortbows, glaives, longbows, longswords, and shortbows."

### Page 50: Legion Recruit
The sidebar is referring to a non-existent feat. In the final sentence of the sidebar, change "Legion Recruit" to "Leech-Clipper."

### Page 51: Pride in Arms feat
Add the auditory trait to the Pride in Arms feat, as it only works if your ally hears the shout.

### Page 53: Fungus leshy
Leshys that take the fungus leshy heritage should be fungi in more than just name! After the heritage's final sentence, add "You lose the plant trait and gain the fungus trait."

### Page 54: Seedpod feat
The Seedpod feat was missing a range. Change the feat's second sentence to 

> "You gain a seedpod ranged unarmed attack with a range increment of 10 feet that deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage; these Strikes have the manipulate trait."

### Page 57: Lizardfolk and catfolk
Lizardfolk and catfolk are from nearby regions and we want to represent their relationship as neighbors, of a sort. Add Amurrun to the list in the lizardfolk base statistics sidebar of additional languages you can choose if you have a positive Intelligence modifier.

> "Your key spellcasting ability for these spells is Charisma."

### Page 104: Halcyon Speaker Dedication
The language in the Halcyon Speaker Dedication was causing confusion as it referenced gaining access to spells. Change the second sentence of the feat to 

> "You gain two common Halcyon cantrips and two common 1st-level halcyon spells (see Halcyon Spells on page 100)."

### Page 112: Pathfinder Agent Feats

### Page 107: Animus mine
The animus mine spell should only the deal the mental damage on magical mental effects that send their magic into your mind, not if a creature tries to do something mundane like talk to you.

## Lost Omens Mwangi Expanse Errata

### Page 103: Anadi Change Shape
The Anadi Change Shape ability should allow a different set of actions in spider form to allow more manipulate actions than it currently does. Change it to say 

> "You change into your human or spider shape. Each shape has a specific, persistent appearance. In your human shape, you can’t use unarmed attacks granted by your ancestry. You aren’t flat footed when climbing in your spider shape. However, in your spider shape you can’t use weapons, shields, or other held items of any sort, and you are limited in what actions you can take that have the manipulate trait. The only manipulate actions you can take are to Cast a Spell with somatic components, weave silk or webbing, or simple Interact actions such as opening an unlocked door. Your spider legs can't perform actions that require fingers or significant manual dexterity, including any action that would require a check to accomplish. The GM might determine other manipulate actions are appropriate for your spider legs"

## Lost Omens World Guide Errata

###  Updated Backgrounds

A number of backgrounds are granting training in the incorrect skills or inappropriate skill feats that didn't correspond with each other. Make the changes as noted below.

#### Page(s) and location, followed by change

##### Page 22: 
Grand Council Bureaucrat: Change "Society" to "Diplomacy" 

##### Page 46: 
Nirmathi Guerilla: Change "Survival" to "Stealth" 

### Page 17: archaic wayfinder
The archaic wayfinder requires investment, just like all other wayfinders. Add the invested trait to the archaic wayfinder.

### Page 23: Wayfinder Resonance Tinkerer

> "As normal, this cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up."

### Page 28: ldori dueling sword
The aldori dueling sword mistakenly cost too much due to a lack of conversion to the silver piece standard for starting gear. Change the Aldori dueling sword's price to 2 gp.

### Page 71: Crimson Shroud
Crimson Shroud is a magical ability and should have a school and a tradition or the magical trait. Add the healing, magical, and necromancy traits to the Crimson Shroud feat.

### Page 95: Magic Warrior archetype
The Magic Warrior archetype should be uncommon, just like the other archetypes in the book. Add the uncommon trait to the Magic Warrior Dedication feat.

Any animal companion can be a megafauna animal companion, which changes how the animal companion can progress at a later time, allowing the animal companion to become a savage or indomitable animal companion instead. The GM has ultimate say on which animal companions can be megafauna animal companions, though most animal companions based on animals and beasts can be megafauna. Before the first sentence of the Megafauna Minions sidebar, add 

> "When you pick your animal companion, you can choose to have it be a megafauna animal companion."

## Lost Omens Ancestry Guide Clarifications and Errata

### What actions qualify for Conduct Energy?

*What actions qualify for the requirements of the resonant weapon trait's Conduct Energy action?*

You can only use Conduct Energy with actions that have one of the required energy traits. Using an action other than a spell that causes damage with the listed trait does not necessarily qualify unless the action also has the trait.

- For example, if you used the ifrit's Scorching Disarm action, you could channel fire energy into your weapon via Conduct Energy, as Scorching Disarm itself has the fire trait.
- However, if you made a Strike with a flaming weapon, the Strike action does not have the fire trait, so you couldn't use Conduct Energy. 

### Pages 6–7: uncomon mistakes 
Fixed several uncomon mistakes.

### Page 11: Purge Sins
Add the "healing" trait to the Purge Sins feat.

### Page 38: Winglets
In the Winglets feat, on the second to last line, change "10 feet higher" to "10 feet longer".

> "This effect has the healing, necromancy, positive, and primal traits."

### Page 51: Mask of Fear 
In the Special line for the Mask of Fear feat, change all instances of "reaction" to "free action".

### Page 79: Beastkin's shape

> "A beastkin’s hybrid form is their natural shape."

### Page 81: Animal Shape
The beastkin's Animal Shape feat was missing options for beastkin with insects as their inherent animal. Make the following changes to the Animal Shape feat:

Change the third sentence to read

> "When you gain this feat, choose either aerial form, animal form, dinosaur form, or insect form; after you choose a form, you can’t change the form."

Change the fifth sentence to read, 

> "If your inherent animal isn’t among the animals listed in the form, you default to the statistics and abilities of the bird battle form, cat battle form, deinonychus battle form, or ant battle form for aerial form, animal form, dinosaur form, and insect form, respectively (at the GM’s discretion, you instead default to a different form that is closest to your inherent animal)."

### Page 89: fleshwarp statistics
The fleshwarp statistics did not fully line up with the flavor presented in the fleshwarp entry. Change the Size entry from "Medium" to "Medium or Small" to allow for Small fleshwarps, which might have originated from existing Small ancestries.

Add the following prerequisites to the Eerie Compression feat:

> **Prerequisites**: Medium size

### Page 123: Dark fields kitsune

> "You lose any temporary Hit Points after 1 minute."

### Page 124: Foxfire
Kitsune's foxfire should be magical. Change the fifth line of the Foxfire feat to read, 

> "Your foxfire is in the sling weapon group and has the magical trait."

### Page 124: Star Orb
Change the last line of the Star Orb feat to read, 

> "It always has the innate surge master ability (Advanced Player’s Guide 147), which counts against your limit for familiar and master abilities."

In the Wing Step feat, change 

> "You Step twice"

> "Rungus were invented by Zenj humans of the Mwangi Expanse and are most common among their tribes, though gripplis have also adopted rungus for hunting creatures that hide high in treetops."

### Page 138: taw launcher
It was unclear if the taw launcher was a crossbow or not and thus function with crossbow-related abilities and effects. The taw launcher is a crossbow. In the first sentence of the taw launcher description, change the word "resembles" to "is".

## Dark Archive Errata

### Page 19: Oscillating wave

The oscillating wave psychic’s unique psi cantrips (thermal stasis, entropic wheel, and redistribute potential) are not intended to interact with their conservation of energy class feature, as they manipulate cold and fire at the same time. Similarly, psi cantrips from other conscious minds (for instance, ones gained through the Parallel Breakthrough feat) shouldn’t interact with conservation of energy. Modify the text in the Conservation of Energy section from 

> “The first time in an encounter that you cast a granted spell from your conscious mind or a psi cantrip” 

to 

> “The first time in an encounter that you cast a granted spell or standard psi cantrip from your conscious mind.”

### Pages 34–35: Thaumaturge Unarmed Proficiency

The thaumaturge should increase in proficiency with unarmed attacks as they grow in level. The weapon expertise class feature should read 

> “You’ve learned the secret ways your weapons work most effectively. Your proficiency ranks for unarmed attacks, simple weapons, and martial weapons increase to expert.” 

The weapon mastery class feature should read 

> “You fully understand your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for unarmed attacks, simple weapons, and martial weapons increase to master.”

### Page 48 Feats granting spellcasting benefits for Psychic

The feats granting spellcasting benefits in the psychic multiclass archetype have some unintended discrepancies from corresponding feats in other multiclass archetypes. 

- First, Master Psychic Spellcasting should be an 18th-level feat, rather than a 12th-level feat. 
- Second, Expert Psychic Spellcasting should have a Prerequisite listing of “Basic Psychic Spellcasting, master in Occultism” and Master Psychic Spellcasting should have a Prerequisite listing of “Expert Psychic Spellcasting, legendary in Occultism.”
