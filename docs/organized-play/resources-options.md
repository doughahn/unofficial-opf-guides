# Resources and Options

## Core Rulebook

### Rarity and Access Adjustments

Please use these rarity and access adjustments in Society Play, instead of the rarity and access printed in the original source.

**Languages**: Note that the adjustment to regional languages (page 432) detailed in the Rulings and Clarifications section below expands some characters' access to Erutaki and Varki.

**Items**: All characters have access to: the scholarly journal, scholarly journal compendium, survey map, and survey map atlas (page 291).

All characters have access to the wayfinder (page 617).

**Spells**: All characters have access to raise dead (page 362).

**Rituals**: All characters have access to atone (page 409) and resurrect (page 415).

### Option Availability

All options are of standard availability unless specifically noted otherwise.

##### Limited

**General Feats**: 

- Connections (page 260).

**Spells**: 

- dreaming potential (page 333)

**Equipment**: 

- Hirelings (page 294); Pathfinder Society characters have access to more capable hirelings through the Achievement Points system.

##### Restricted

None.

### Rulings and Clarifications

Please follow these rulings and clarifications specific to Pathfinder Society play wherever they conflict with the language printed in the original source.

- The level 1 version of summon plant or fungus (page 376) can be used to summon a leaf leshy (Pathfinder Bestiary page 218) that has the weak adjustment (Pathfinder Bestiary page 6). This is an exception to the rule that summon spells do not normally allow you to adjust the level of the summoned monsters by applying adjustments or templates to them.
- The Experienced Smuggler skill feat (page 261) allows you to Earn Income using Underworld Lore with tasks of your level –1, instead of the normal level –2.
- Add the following regional languages to the options listed on page 432. As with other regional languages, a character hailing from the region listed below automatically has access to these languages.
  - Erutaki: Saga Lands
  - Varki: Saga Lands
- Some creatures have abilities that only end or trigger when they are killed. In Organized Play, abilities that only end when a creature is killed end when a summoned version of the creature is banished. Abilities that trigger when a creature is killed do not trigger when banishing a summoned creature, including when a creature is reduced to 0 Hit Points and banished per the Summoned trait.

## Gamemastery guide

he Gamemastery Guide primarily contains tools for GMs, new subsystems, and rules variants rather than direct player options, all content from this book is of limited availability. However, Organized Play will be drawing from the rules options in this book in creating future adventures, boons, and other content.

## Advanced Players Guide

#### Rarity and Access Adjustments

**Ancestries**: Due to years of successful Pathfinder Society activities, all characters have access to the kobold ancestry (page 12).

**Archetypes**: All characters have access to the vigilante archetype (page 196).

### Option Availability

##### Standard

All options are of standard availability unless specifically noted otherwise.

**Ancestries**: All ancestry and versatile heritage options, other than kobolds, are of standard availability. As the catfolk, orc, ratfolk, and tengu ancestries and the aasimar, changeling, dhampir, duskwalker, and tiefling versatile heritages are uncommon, this means they are limited to boon access through Chronicle Sheets or the Achievement Point system. Orc feats can continue to be taken by half-orc characters who meet the prerequisites or access requirements, as normal.

##### Limited

**Ancestries**: Defy the Darkness (page 42)
**Items**: earthsight box (page 260)
**Feats**: A Home in Every Port (page 202)

- Biographical Eye (page 203)
- Consult the Spirits (page 204)
- Criminal Connections (page 204)
- Underground Network (page 209)

##### Restricted

**Feats**

- Connect the Dots (page 62)
- Whodunnit? (page 63)
- Plot the Future (page 64)

**Spells**: 

- ghostly tragedy (page 220)

### Rulings and Clarifications

Please follow these rulings and clarifications specific to Pathfinder Society play wherever they conflict with the language printed in the original source.

- The snares created with the Snare Genius kobold ancestry feat (page 15) are temporary items and become unusable after 24 hours or during your next daily preparations, whichever comes first.
- The Tusks orc ancestry feat (page 18) requires the character to file down their tusks or perform a similar action to retrain; this is part of the normal retraining process and does not take any additional time.
- The temporary Hit Points granted by the Spell Devourer orc ancestry feat (page 19) are applied as soon as the character succeeds at their saving throw; for an effect that causes Hit Point damage on a successful save, such as a fireball, this means that the character gains the temporary Hit Points before taking damage.
- Unless specifically noted otherwise, most wands and scrolls are less than 1 foot long and can fit into a ratfolk’s Cheek Pouches (page 22).
- Per design team clarification, the Homeward Bound gnome feat (page 44) should be of uncommon rarity.
- Per design team clarification, the Speed penalty inflicted by the Kneecap feat (page 45) has a duration of 1 round.
- GMs should provide a character with the That’s Odd investigator feat (page 60) a hint whenever the character enters a room with hidden aspects, specifically with regard to hidden passageways (such as scuff marks near a bookcase that’s actually a swinging door), creatures or hazards (such as drippage on the floor from an unseen fungus growing on the rafters), or valuables (such as bunched carpet over a secret compartment in the floor that contains a bag of coins). The GM does not need to provide clues for rooms that have no significant secret or hidden features. These clues should indicate only that the character should investigate a given section of the room, not let them automatically uncover the hidden element or provide any additional information beyond signaling its presence.
- GMs should let a character with the Sense the Unseen investigator feat (page 64) know when the trigger for the ability has been met so they can use the feat if they so choose.
- Given the slightly relaxed rules around edicts and anathema in Society play, a barbarian with the superstition instinct (page 108) can benefit from spells and magic items if they are an unavoidable part of a Society adventure, such as if a scenario assumes the PCs are transported to their mission location via a teleport spell, or if an adventure requires that all PCs participate in a magical ritual.
- Per design team clarification, when a barbarian uses the Sunder Spell feat (page 111) against a spell like wall of fire that does not have a listed AC, the Strike hits automatically—the barbarian simply rolls the counteract check. 
- A cavalier (page 184) can pledge to a legal deity, religion, or pantheon, an organization they have access to, or the Pathfinder Society. The edicts and anathema of the Pathfinder Society are as follows:
  - Edicts: Explore important sites, report and record your discoveries, and cooperate with fellow Pathfinders
  - Anathema: Fail to explore, report and cooperate; defy the will of a venture-captain or the Decemvirate
- A vigilante’s Safe House (page 196), can be located in any city or near any lodge they have received a Pathfinder briefing. A vigilante can use their downtime to relocate their safe house. A vigilante can use their safe house only if it is in the town or location where their current adventure is taking place.
- The DCs for the Armor Assist feat (page 203) are not subject to GM adjudication. Rather, simply use the default DCs listed in the feat: 15 for common armor, 20 for uncommon armor, and 25 for rare armor.
- For the purposes of Society play, the Targets entry for the claim undead (page 230) oracle revelation spell is “1 mindless undead creature”, not “1 undead creature.” The intent of this change is to reduce the prevalence of domination magic on sapient creatures in Society play.
- Strikes made by a malicious shadow (page 238) use the spellcaster’s spell attack roll.

## Secrets of Magic

### Option Availability

##### Standard

All options are of standard availability unless specifically noted otherwise.

##### Limited

**Class Feats**

- Arcane Shroud (Magus; page 48)

**Spells**

- bandit’s doom (page 90)
- glimmer of charm (page 108)
- inner radiance torrent (page 112)
- nullify (page 118)
- shift blame (page 129)
- sudden recollection (page 130)

- ghostly portal paint (page 173)

**Archetypes**

- Cathartic Mage (page 194)
- Soulforger (page 236)
- Wellspring Mage (page 248)

**Other Rules**

Pathfinder Society does not use the rules for Cathartic Magic (page 194), Ley Lines (page 214), Pervasive Magic (pages 218-223), Soul Seeds (page 230), or True Names (page 244). Any associated character options should be considered Limited.
Restricted

**Eidolons**

- Demon eidolons (page 62) and any evil eidolons

### Rulings and Clarifications

Please follow these rulings and clarifications specific to Pathfinder Society play wherever they conflict with the language printed in the original source.

##### Backgrounds
The lore chosen from the Eidolon Contact background can only be associated with a specific creature or category of creatures, not a broad creature type.

##### Eidolons

Eidolons are not PCs, so they do not count as PCs for effects that scale based on the number of PCs or players.

Eidolons and summoners share a pool of actions. As a result, for Victory Point/success counting systems that allow each PC a limited number of chances to roll, either the summoner or the eidolon can attempt each check. The summoner's player chooses for each attempt which of the two rolls. Any direct consequences of failure apply to whichever creature rolled the check.

This rule does not mean that in general only one of the summoner or eidolon need to roll to deal with adverse situations. If everyone in a room needs to attempt a saving throw against a hazard, both the eidolon and the summoner need to attempt that saving throw. If every PC needs to overcome a particular obstacle in order to continue (such as crossing a chasm), the eidolon and summoner both need to get past the obstacle.

##### Classes

A magus with the Laughing Shadow hybrid study replaces shift blame with time jump as their 11th level Studious Spell.

##### Class Feats 

Using the Phase Out summoner ability (page 70) means that your eidolon cannot make any Strikes, nor can it take any actions requiring a physical form.

##### Items

Fulus do not expire after one year. Players cannot create their own fulus or personal staves. A basic retrieval prism must be attuned to a PC to function. The holy water generated by an anointed waterskin does not persist beyond the end of a session and has an effective sale price of 0 gp.

##### Spells 

The summon lesser servitor spell cannot be used to summon imps.

## Guns & Gears

### Rarity and Access Adjustments

- All Pathfinder Society agents have access to the Gunslinger and Inventor classes and archetypes.
- Inventors (and characters with the Inventor archetype) gain access to uncommon clockwork items and gadgets from Chapters 1 and 2 of this book, unless the item specifically states otherwise. 
- Gunslingers (and characters with the Gunslinger archetype) gain access to all uncommon weapons, ammunition, and related items from Chapter 4 of this book, with the exception of Beast Guns and any limited or restricted items below, unless the item indicates otherwise.
- As stated on page 148 of Guns & Gears, feats that grant access to weapons with ancestry traits (such as Dwarven Weapon Familiarity), do not grant access to firearms with the listed trait unless the character separately has access to firearms. The reverse is also true, that general access to firearms does not grant access to ancestry-specific weapons. If you have access to firearms, you can gain access to firearms with an ancestry trait (dwarf, elf, goblin, etc.) by selecting an ancestry feat or other option that specifically grants it (for example, to gain access to a clan pistol, take the Clan Pistol feat or Dwarven Weapon Familiarity feat). 
- Characters with a Home Region of Absalom, New Thassilon, or Arcadia have access to uncommon clockwork items from Chapters 1 and 2, as inventors.
- Characters with a Home Region of Alkenstar, Dongun Hold, or the Shackles have access to all black powder guns, ammunition and related accessories; and all archetypes from Chapter 3 with the exception of beast gunner, fireworks technician, and spellshot. Characters from Alkenstar or Dongun Hold also have access to uncommon clockwork items from Chapters 1 and 2, as inventors.
- Characters with a Home Region of Tian Xia or Vudra have access to hand cannons and fire lances, associated ammunition and accessories; and the fireworks technician archetype.
- Characters with a Home Region of Arcadia have access to air guns, beast guns, non-black powder ammunition and accessories; and all archetypes from Chapter 3 with the exception of fireworks technician and demolitionist.
- Players who own a copy of the Goblin Fireworks Fight board game gain access to the fireworks technician archetype for all their characters. A copy of the game’s instruction booklet is sufficient to prove ownership.
- Characters with access to a firearm also automatically are granted access to the firearm cleaning kit and basic ammunition for that weapon, if necessary (e.g. characters with access to a flintlock pistol also have access to firearm ammunition).

### Option Availability

##### Restricted

**Archetypes**

- Demolitionist (page 133)

**Feats**

### Rulings and Clarifications

Please follow these rulings and clarifications specific to Pathfinder Society play wherever they conflict with the language printed in the original source.

- For the automaton’s Rain of Bolts feat, the DC is the higher of your class DC or spell DC.
- For the purpose of gunslinger feats and abilities, if the ability states that you fire your weapon, you fire your weapon; if it does not state as such, you do not have to fire your weapon. Notably, Fake Out does not require you to actually fire your weapon.
- For the gunslinger’s Alchemical Shot feat and any similar abilities that change a weapon’s damage type, only the primary damage’s type is affected; any secondary effects (such as precision damage or damage applied from a rune) are not affected.
- For the gunslinger’s Dance of Fire feat, the first set of three actions must be resolved before subsequent sets of actions can be taken.
- Characters with the Sniping Duo archetype may choose their sniping partner at the beginning of the scenario without spending Downtime to retrain the option.
- The clan pistol’s ammunition costs 1 sp for 10 rounds.
- The glitterdust spell cast by the fairy bullet has a DC of 23 (as is standard for a 7th-level item).
- Weapons that install an air cartridge firing system and that have the kickback trait retain the trait and the associated drawbacks.

## Dark Archive

A reminder that in keeping with the “Explore, Report, Cooperate” motto of the Pathfinder Society, engaging in non-consensual character-versus-character conflict is prohibited. While accidental friendly fire happens due to missed attack rolls or other factors, players must obtain the consent of other players before taking an action that would include another PC in a damaging effect or other or harmful effect (such as effects that impose negative conditions). 

Some examples include casting a harmful spell on another PC or an area that includes them, throwing a splash weapon that would deal splash damage to another PC, or moving closer to another PC while surrounded by a harmful emanation in a way that exposes them to its effects.

This rule does not apply in situations where a character is not acting of their own free will, such as if they’re being mind-controlled by an NPC and forced to attack a fellow Pathfinder.

### Rulings and Clarifications

- Characters with the Reflection versatile heritage may not be a Reflection of any known and named NPC in Pathfinder canon. Your appearance may be used to strengthen your character’s story and roleplay, but cannot be used to impact gameplay during Organized Play adventures.
- Per design clarification, change the third sentence of the psychic’s Conservation of Energy ability to read 
    - > The first time in an encounter that you cast a granted spell from your conscious mind or a standard psi cantrip[...]” 
    - The intent is for Conservation of Energy to apply to produce flame and ray of frost, but not the unique cantrips, which are designed to function as written.

### Rarity and Access Adjustments

As of the start of Pathfinder Society Year 3 (August 2021), all characters have access to the leshy ancestry without requiring a boon.
Option Availability

##### Standard

**Ancestries** 

All ancestry options are of standard availability. As the hobgoblin and lizardfolk ancestries are uncommon, this means they are limited to boon access through Chronicle Sheets or the Achievement Point system. The leshy ancestry is open to all characters; however, all other leshy options follow the standard access rules.

All other options are of standard availability unless specifically noted otherwise.

##### Limited

None.

##### Restricted

### Rulings and Clarifications

- The following rulings and clarifications are based on upcoming errata for this product.
- The design and development teams have clarified that the ancient elf heritage (page 25) requires an elven lifespan (a feature that half-elves do not have) and thus cannot be selected by half-elves using the Elf Atavism feat (Core Rulebook 58), only by full elves. Clarifying text has been added to the errata for this book.
- Eclectic Obsession (page 33) should be a single action and have the one-action symbol accordingly.
- Hobgoblin Weapon Familiarity (page 50) should contain fewer weapons. The updated text should read “You are trained with composite longbows, composite shortbows, glaives, longbows, longswords, and shortbows.”
- Leshys with the fungus leshy heritage (page 53) do not have the plant trait listed in the leshy base statistics sidebar, but have the fungus trait instead.

- Per design team clarification, an item animated by the spirit object (page 32) hex uses the spellcaster’s spell DC as its AC. Its Hardness and Hit Points remain unchanged from their normal values as listed on page 577 of the Core Rulebook.
- If a target of all is one, one is all (page 64) does not consent to the allocation of Hit Points resulting from this spell, they become an unwilling target and they (and their Hit Points) are removed from the spell’s effect. The spell can continue with any remaining targets.

- The blade within a stiletto pen (page 30) is a simple weapon.
- All versions of metalmist spheres in this book (page 38) contain either cold iron or silver.

## Lost Omens Ancestry Guide

### Option Availability

##### Standard

All options are of Standard availability unless specifically noted otherwise.

##### Restricted

**Feats** 

- Strix Defender (page 136)

### Rulings and Clarifications

Please follow these rulings and clarifications specific to Pathfinder Society play wherever they conflict with the language printed in the original source.

- Taste Blood (page 27): As specified in the feat, a PC who uses this feat on an unwilling target that is not an active combatant commits an evil act; in Pathfinder Society play, doing so earns the PC 1 Point of Infamy.
- Cloak of Poison (page 43): “An unarmed attack or melee weapon without the reach trait” refers to all unarmed attacks (whether they have the reach trait or not), as well as melee weapons without the reach trait.
- Tengu Feather Fan (page 48): The fan you gain from this feat is a held item (Pathfinder Core Rulebook 572).
- Hefting Shadow (page 87): Creatures other than the PC with the feat can store or retrieve items from the shadow; doing so is equally difficult to storing or retrieving items in a worn backpack (generally requiring Steal or a similar ability if the PC does not consent to have the item taken).
- Hybrid Form (page 124): Characters with hybrid form can retain elements of their kitsune form when they use Change Shape, but they do not have to (they can still change fully into their alternative form).
- [NEW 4/27/22] In Pathfinder Society play, corgi familiars can be independent. When a corgi is being ridden, it is following your PC's lead, and therefore does not apply any of the benefits or effects of being independent
