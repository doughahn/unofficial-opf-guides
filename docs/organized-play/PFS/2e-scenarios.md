#### 2E Scenarios
Below is a sortable table of published 2e scenarios. Hover over a column heading to sort ascending or descending. 

<!-- Need to add this div before the table to make it sortable because you can't add a class -->
<div class="sortable-table"></div>

Note that Exclusives and Glyphs are used interchangeably by Paizo. The author's understanding is that Glyph-tagged, non-special (non-exclusive) can be repeated up to 3 times to count for the 10 specials. Specials (regardless of how they're tagged) count an unlimited number of times. While 2-00 King in Thorns has neither the glyph not exclusive tage, it came out before these were created and should have them, as it's an interactive special.
