### Ancestral Adoption I 

**Ancestral Adoption** (Slotless): Whether you grew up with an unlikely family or have since been adopted into an uncommon culture, you have a powerful connection to an uncommon ancestry’s techniques. When you gain the Adopted Ancestry feat (Pathfinder Core Rulebook 258), you can choose either hobgoblin, leshy, or lizardfolk in place of a common ancestry. The following are the ancestry feats you can select from these three options.

- **Hobgoblin**: Agonizing Rebuke, Alchemical Scholar, Expert Drill Sergeant, Hobgoblin Lore, Hobgoblin Weapon Discipline, Hobgoblin Weapon Expertise, Hobgoblin Weapon Familiarity, Leech-Clipper, Pride in Arms, Remorseless Lash

- **Lizardfolk**: Lizardfolk Lore, Marsh Runner, Reptile Speaker, Terrain Advantage
 

### Evolving Destiny

**[ ] Evolving Destiny** (Limited-Use, Service): Your early adventures have exposed you to difficult realities, forcing you to re-examine your skillset. Fortunately, your career is young, and course-correction is fairly straightforward. Between adventures, you can check the box that precedes this boon to completely rebuild your character so long as they have 48 or fewer XP (the Career Change boon allows you to rebuild a character of any level). Remove everything your character has purchased with gp, as well as their class, feats, skill proficiencies, and related features. You may not alter the character's ancestry, heritage or background, but you may change the ability score boosts you selected at character creation. Your character’s wealth is set to 85% of the total gold you’ve earned—this reduction represents a small amount lost from consumable use as well as items sold back for a particularly favorable rate. This rebuilding process does not change the amount of Fame, Reputation, or gp the character has earned, nor does it change the resources your character has expended on services such as spellcasting.

You can also refund any faction boons for the Fame price at which you purchased them, though you cannot sell back Limited-Use boons that you have expended or Faction Champion boons that you have used to earn Reputation for a faction.

All changes to the character must be applied by the time the character next plays an adventure; once the adventure begins, no further changes can be made with this boon.
 
### Career Change

**[ ] Career Change** (Limited-Use, Service): Your existing abilities have helped you achieve success in the field, but you’re overdue for a drastic change if you’re to continue succeeding in the adventures to come. Between adventures, you can check the box that precedes this boon to completely rebuild your character. Remove everything your character has purchased with gp, as well as their class, feats, skill proficiencies, and related features. You may not alter the character's ancestry, heritage or background, but you may change the ability score boosts you selected at character creation. Your character’s wealth is set to 85% of the total gold you’ve earned—this reduction represents a small amount lost from consumable use as well as items sold back for a particularly favorable rate. This rebuilding process does not change the amount of Fame, Reputation, or gp the character has earned, nor does it change the resources your character has expended on services such as spellcasting.

You can also refund any faction boons for the Fame price at which you purchased them, though you cannot sell back Limited-Use boons that you have expended or Faction Champion boons that you have used to earn Reputation for a faction.

All changes to the character must be applied by the time the character next plays an adventure; once the adventure begins, no further changes can be made with this boon.

### Treasure Bundle Insurance 

**[ ] [ ] [ ]** Even when your careful searching doesn’t uncover all of a site’s valuables, you’re able to appraise, repair, and certify what you did recover to maximize their value. You can check a box that precedes this boon at the end of a scenario when you and your allies recovered 9 or fewer of the adventure’s Treasure Bundles. Increase the effective number of Treasure Bundles recovered by 1 for the purpose of calculating the group’s gold piece rewards.

The total number of additional Treasure Bundles provided by this boon cannot exceed the adventure's maximum (10, for a typical scenario).

**Special**: Multiple copies of this boon can be used during the same adventure, but only to recover up to a total of three lost Treasure Bundles.
 
### Second Chance 

**[ ] Second Chance** (Limited-Use, Service): Adventuring is deadly business, but you have a powerful favor you can call in if your travels result in a premature death. You can check the box that precedes this boon to gain the benefits of the resurrect ritual (Pathfinder Core Rulebook page 415), so long as the ritual’s total cost in diamonds does not exceed 1,000 gp. If the ritual would cost more than 1,000 gp, you must pay any additional costs beyond 1,000 gp. 

The ritual takes 1 day to perform and automatically succeeds.
 

### Secondary Initiation

Your contacts have introduced you to an influential member of another organization, allowing you to join that group or train in some of their techniques. Select an organization other than the Pathfinder Society. For the purpose of fulfilling prerequisites and Access conditions, you are treated as being a member of that group in addition to your belonging to the Pathfinder Society.

**Special**: You can apply this boon multiple times to the same character, but each time you apply it, you relinquish your membership in the previous group in order to join a different group. Before doing so, you must retrain any options that listed membership in your previous group as a prerequisite.

### Bequeathal boons

**Update January 2022**: Previously, this boon had a stipulation that the character receiving the option must wait until they reached the level of the original chronicle sheet to use the option. This text was removed as it was redundant.

Pathfinders often find strange treasures for which they might not have any use. In keeping with the Society's ethos of cooperation, generous Pathfinders spend some of their own time and resources tracking down other agents who could benefit more from these rewards. When you acquire this boon, select one [Uncommon/Rare/Unique] character option to which you’ve gained access through an adventure’s Chronicle Sheet or via a no-cost boon from the online boon store (e.g., a listed magic item or a boon that allows you to acquire a special animal companion). 

Choose another of your characters. That character gains access to that special option instead. The receiving PC must also meet any prerequisites for the boon (e.g. they must be Liked by a particular faction to access that faction’s unique gear from Lost Omens Pathfinder Society Guide). On the Chronicle Sheet or Boon, write “Bequeathed” and the recipient character’s number next to the option. You no longer have access to that option (and must retrain the character option or sell an item back for full cost if you acquired the option and would no longer qualify for it).

Option Chosen: _______________________________________

Bequeathed To: -20__________

#### Does the Bequeathal boon allow you to transfer Chronicle Boons that have no rarity?

No, it does not. The boon allows you to transfer access to character options. The reference to Chronicle Sheets and rewards from the boon store exists to tell you which places that you could gain access are eligible for transfer via Bequeathal.

#### Heroic Defiance 

When you spend your Hero Points to avoid death, you can choose to immediately wake up with 1 Hit Point.

#### Adversary Lore 

It doesn’t matter how powerful your weapons are if you don’t know where to strike. You have taken the time to study a certain category of creatures, making it easier to recall their capabilities later. When you purchase this boon, either select one creature type from List 1 below, or choose two creature types from List 2. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Recall Knowledge about creatures of the selected type(s). If your Reputation tier with the Vigilant Seal is Revered, this bonus increases to +2.

**List 1**: [ ]aberration, [ ]animal, [ ]beast, [ ]construct, [ ]dragon, [ ]elemental, [ ]fiend, [ ]undead.

**List 2**: [ ]astral, [ ]celestial, [ ]ethereal, [ ]fey, [ ]fungus, [ ]giant, [ ]monitor, [ ]ooze, [ ]plant.

**Special**: You can apply this boon multiple times to the same character. However, the character must focus their training on one set of creatures before each adventure, and cannot benefit from multiple copies of the boon at the same time.


#### Adamant Wayfinder

You have specially reinforced your wayfinder, devising a way for the device to absorb harmful energies. When you purchase this boon, you apply its benefits to one wayfinder in your possession, granting you a special  ability when the wayfinder is invested and in your possession. You gain the following reaction.

**Resist Harm** (reaction); Trigger You would take damage; Effect You gain resistance 1 to acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, negative, positive, and sonic damage  against one attack, spell, or effect. This applies only to the initial effect, not to any subsequent attacks or damage dealt by the effect (such as persistent damage or an ongoing hazard). This resistance increases to 2 when your reach the Admired Reputation tier with Vigilant Seal, and to 4 when you reach the Revered Reputation Tier.

You can safely use this benefit once per adventure. You can attempt to use it a second time, overcharging the wayfinder at the risk of destroying it. When you do so, roll a DC 10 flat check. On a success, the wayfinder is broken. On a failure, the wayfinder is destroyed. If anyone tries to overcharge a wayfinder that’s already been overcharged, the item is automatically destroyed (even if it has been repaired) and does not provide the activated benefit.

**Special**: You can apply multiple upgrades to a single wayfinder. Each upgrade only affects one wayfinder in your possession, chosen when the boon is purchased. If a wayfinder has multiple upgrades on it, you can only safely use each ability once per scenario.

If the wayfinder with this upgrade is destroyed, you can apply the upgrade to another wayfinder during Downtime for no additional cost beyond that of the wayfinder itself.

#### Curse Breaker

You have been entrusted with an accursed item from the Society’s vaults, and you can spend your time in the Grand Lodge patiently unraveling its malign influence. When you acquire this boon, choose a permanent magic item of your level or lower to which you have access. You can spend Downtime erasing the item’s stubborn curse. This uses the same rules as you would to Craft the item, with the following exceptions. First, you must use Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion in place of Crafting for all purposes.  Second, you only need to spend 2 days of Downtime before attempting your first skill check and subsequently beginning to reduce the item’s effective cost. 

You can uncurse more than one magic item with this boon, but you must finish uncursing one item before beginning the next.

### Radiant Oath Boons

#### Protective Mentor

While working with less experienced Pathfinder allies, you shield your more fragile wards from the threat of death. For any PCs benefiting from a Level Bump and whose levels are lower than yours, you increase their current and maximum Hit Points by an additional amount equal to 3 times your Radiant Oath reputation tier (Liked = 1, Admired = 2, Revered = 3).

#### Heroic Intervention

Your heroic moments grant others the will to keep fighting. When you spend a Hero Point, you and any allies within 30 feet who can see you regain 3d6 Hit Points (4d6 if your Radiant Oath reputation tier is 4). This healing also affects dying allies, even if they cannot see you due to being unconscious.

Must be Admired by Radiant Oath to obtain.  

#### Practiced Medic

By spending your off-hours administering medical aid to those in need, you have developed extraordinary first aid instincts. After purchasing this boon, you can spend Downtime to provide medical services to others. Once you have expended 8 days of Downtime in this way, you can expend the boon as a free action before attempting a Medicine check to Administer First Aid, Treat Disease, Treat Poison, or Treat Wounds. You improve your check’s degree of success by one step (such as if you roll a failure, you get a success instead); the boon is not expended if your original roll is a critical success. Once you expend this boon, it provides no other benefit.

**Special**: You can apply this boon multiple times to the same character, though you cannot expend more than one copy of this boon per adventure.
 
### Radiant Wayfinder 

You have specially augmented your wayfinder, devising a way for the device to reveal hidden creatures. When you purchase this boon, you apply its benefits to one wayfinder in your possession, granting it the following activation ability.

**Activate** [two-action] command (evocation, good, light) Effect The wayfinder glows with a spiritual radiance, revealing that which is hidden. 

This has the effects of faerie fire, except the effect occurs in a 10-foot radius centered around you.

You can safely use this benefit once per adventure. You can attempt to use it a second time, overcharging the wayfinder at the risk of destroying it. When you do so, roll a DC 10 flat check. On a success, the wayfinder is broken. On a failure, the wayfinder is destroyed. If anyone tries to overcharge a wayfinder that’s already been overcharged, the item is automatically destroyed (even if it has been repaired) and does not provide the activated benefit.

**Special**: You can apply multiple upgrades to a single wayfinder. Each upgrade only affects one wayfinder in your possession, chosen when the boon is purchased. If a wayfinder has multiple upgrades on it, you can only safely use each ability once per scenario.

If the wayfinder with this upgrade is destroyed, you can apply the upgrade to another wayfinder during Downtime for no additional cost beyond that of the wayfinder itself.

#### Ward Against Fiends 

Your allies in the Radiant Oath faction performed a ritual to grant you holy protection against demons, daemons, devils, and similar evil beings. Once per adventure, when you roll a critical failure on a saving throw against a fiend, you get a failure instead.

### Verdant Wheel Boons

#### Worldly Mentor 

While working with less experienced Pathfinder allies, you help your less experienced colleagues recognize danger and withstand danger. For any PCs benefiting from a Level Bump and whose levels are lower than yours, you increase the Level Bump’s modifier to Perception checks and Initiative rolls to 2.

Must be Liked by Verdant Wheel to obtain. 

#### Heroic Aegis 

When spending Hero Points to avert death, gain a +2 status bonus to AC and saving throws. Must be Admired by Verdant Wheel to obtain. 

#### Naturalist

When you apply this boon, choose a common alchemical item or potion of your level or lower to which you have access. The Verdant Wheel has taught you how to craft this item far more efficiently and provided you with a source for the rare herbs and ingredients needed to make 1 batch (typically 4 copies of the item). Making the item with the Verdant Wheel's method uses the standard rules for Crafting the item, with the following exceptions. First, you must use Nature, Survival, or Herbalism Lore in place of Crafting for all purposes.  Second, you only need to spend 2 days of Downtime before attempting your first skill check and subsequently beginning to reduce the item’s effective cost. 

**Special**: You can apply this boon multiple times to the same character.
 
#### Leshy Companion

You can select the Leshy Familiar feat as a 2nd level class feat, even if you are not a druid. You can ignore the prerequisite of belonging to the leaf order.

When you apply this boon, you can retrain your 2nd level class feat to Leshy Companion without spending Downtime.


#### Natural Skill

If you are at least trained in Nature, you gain a bonus skill feat from the following list: Natural Medicine, Quick Identification, Recognize Spell, or Train Animal. If you have already selected one of these feats, you can freely retrain your selection.
