<p>Halfling and Orc Weapon Familiarity has the wrong language for how to treat weapons with the halfling or orc trait; all ancestries with Weapon Familiarity should only treat the weapons as a different category for the purpose of determining proficiency.

<li>All three of these abilities grant a two-tier benefit on a failed saving throw of the specified type, but (as always) no ability will ever change your degree of success by more than one step.

<p>In the alchemist's Chirurgeon section, change “lesser elixir of life” to “minor elixir of life.” The lesser elixir of life is a 3rd-level item that a 1st-level character can’t create.</p>
<p>In the Mutagenist section, remove the second paragraph, which provides an obsolete benefit. Replace it with the following free action.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mutagenic Flashback [free-action]</strong> <br />
    Alchemist, Manipulate <br />

    You experience a brief resurgence of a mutagen. Choose one mutagen you’ve consumed since your last daily preparations. You gain the effects of that mutagen for 1 minute.</p>

<p>Several alchemist class feats reference benefits for alchemical items “you created,” which isn’t relevant in the wider rule set. Remove “you created” from Feral Mutagen, Elastic Mutagen, Invincible Mutagen, Expanded Splash, Genius Mutagen, Persistent Mutagen, and Mindblank Mutagen.</p>
<h6 id="page-79">Page 79:<a class="headerlink" href="#page-79" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h6>
<p>In the alchemist's Merciful Elixir class feat, add to the end of the last sentence “using the item’s level and a counteract modifier equal to your class DC – 10.” to define the counteract modifier.</p>
<h6 id="page-81">Page 81:<a class="headerlink" href="#page-81" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h6>
<p>In the alchemist's Improbable Elixirs class feature, change the third and fourth sentences to read “You gain formulas to create these potions as alchemical items with the elixir trait.

<h6 id="page-85">Page 85:<a class="headerlink" href="#page-85" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h6>
<p>In the barbarian's greater juggernaut class feature, change the last sentence to read “When you roll a failure on a Fortitude save against an effect that deals damage, you halve the damage you take.” This removes confusion about how to handle critical failures on saves against damaging effects.</p>

<p>In Table 3–3: Animal Instincts, change the deer’s Damage entry to 1d10 P and replace the “charge” trait with the “grapple” trait.</p>
<h6 id="page-87">Page 87:<a class="headerlink" href="#page-87" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h6>
<p>In the barbarian's Titan Mauler (Instinct Ability), change “You gain access to a weapon one size larger than you” to “You gain access to this larger weapon” This accounts for Small creatures using a weapon built for a Large creature, as stated in the previous sentence.</p>
<h6 id="page-90">Page 90:<a class="headerlink" href="#page-90" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h6>
<p>In the barbarian's Wounded Rage class feat, remove the Rage trait.</p>
<h6 id="page-91_1">Page 91:<a class="headerlink" href="#page-91_1" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h6>
<p>In the barbarian's Terrifying Howl class feat, change “each creature” to “each enemy.”</p>
<h6 id="page-93">Page 93:<a class="headerlink" href="#page-93" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h6>
<p>The barbarian's Dragon Transformation class feat uses your class DC for the breath weapon at 16th and at 18th levels, rather than the DC listed for 18th level.</p>

<p>In the bard's Eclectic Skill class feat, change the second sentence to “Your proficiency bonus to untrained skill checks is equal to your level.” This matches the language of the Untrained Improvisation general feat and removes any ambiguity as to whether they combine.</p>
<h6 id="page-103">Page 103:<a class="headerlink" href="#page-103" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h6>
<p>Remove the Requirement in the bard's Effortless Concentration to match all the other Effortless Concentration feats.</p>
<h6 id="page-108">Page 108:<a class="headerlink" href="#page-108" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h6>

<h6 id="page-108_1">Page 108:<a class="headerlink" href="#page-108_1" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h6>
<p>In the champion's Divine Ally feat, change the first three sentences to read “A spirit of battle dwells within your armaments. Select one weapon or handwraps of mighty blows when you make your daily preparations. In your hands, the item gains the effect of a property rune.” This supports champions with a deity that has an unarmed attack as a favored weapon.</p>
<h6 id="page-112">Page 112:<a class="headerlink" href="#page-112" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h6>
<p>Add tenets of good to the Prerequisites of Smite Evil. We accidentally omitted it.</p>
<h6 id="page-113">Page 113:<a class="headerlink" href="#page-113" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h6>
<p>Blade of Justice should not be limited to paladins only. Remove the paladin prerequisite from Blade of Justice, and the last sentence becomes "Whether or not the target is evil, you can convert all the physical damage from the attack into good damage, and if you are a paladin, the Strike applies all effects that normally apply on a Retributive Strike (such as divine smite)."</p>
<h6 id="page-121">Page 121:<a class="headerlink" href="#page-121" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h6>
<p>Deadly Simplicity had a benefit for unarmed attack favored weapons, but such clerics did not actually qualify. Change the prerequisites to add unarmed attacks.</p>
<p>Several classes were accidentally missing an important limitation for 10th level spells. In the following class features, add “You can’t use this spell slot for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or that give you more spell slots.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Page 121: Miraculous Spell</li>
<li>Page 133: Primal Hierophant </li>
<li>Page 207: Archwizard's Spellcraft</li>
</ul>

<p>Druid mistakenly was trained in a class DC, when it shouldn't have a class DC. Remove it.</p>
<h6 id="page-132">Page 132:<a class="headerlink" href="#page-132" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h6>
<p>In Table 3–11:

<h6 id="page-135">Page 135:<a class="headerlink" href="#page-135" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h6>

<h6 id="page-138">Page 138:<a class="headerlink" href="#page-138" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h6>
<p>In Plant Shape, the level of the plant form spell if you don't have Wild Shape wasn't clear. It should say it's " heightened to the same level as your highest druid spell slot"</p>
<h6 id="page-139_1">Page 139:<a class="headerlink" href="#page-139_1" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h6>
<p>Hierophant's Power wasn't supposed to have the prerequisite of legendary in Nature; it's a holdover from the playtest. Remove the prerequisite.</p>
<h6 id="page-145">Page 145:<a class="headerlink" href="#page-145" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h6>
<p>The adjustment to the Aid reaction after the playtest caused Assisting Shot not to do anything. Replace it with this version. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Assisting Shot [one-action] Feat 2</strong><br />
Fighter, Press<br />
Requirements You are wielding a ranged weapon.<br />
With a quick shot, you interfere with a foe in combat. Make a Strike with a ranged weapon. If the strike hits, the next creature other than you to attack the same target before the start of your next turn gains a +1 circumstance bonus on their roll, or a +2 circumstance bonus if your Strike was a critical hit.  </p>

<h6 id="page-163">Page 163:<a class="headerlink" href="#page-163" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h6>
<p>Sleeper Hold shouldn't have the attack trait, meaning it doesn't apply or increase your multiple attack penalty.</p>

<p>In order to make it completely clear how the Manifold Edge feat works, change the second sentence to read "When you use Hunt Prey, you can gain a hunter’s edge benefit other than the one you selected at 1st level." With the previous wording, a few people thought you gained both benefits, rather than a substitution.</p>
<h6 id="page-184">Page 184:<a class="headerlink" href="#page-184" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h6>

<p>We've simplified the way we're handling characters carrying their gear so that you can define all your carried items in one of three categories. Replace the carrying and using items section with this text: "A character carries items in three ways: held, worn, and stowed. Held items are in your hands; a character typically has two hands, allowing them to hold an item in each hand or a single two-handed item using both hands. Worn items are tucked into pockets, belt pouches, bandoliers, weapon sheaths, and so forth, and they can be retrieved and returned relatively quickly. Stowed items are in a backpack or a similar container, and they are more difficult to access. Drawing a worn item or changing how you’re carrying an item usually requires you to use an Interact action (though to drop an item, you use the Release action instead). Table 6–2: </p>
<p>Changing Equipment on page 273 lists some ways that you might change the items you’re holding or carrying, and the number of hands you need to do so. Many ways of using items require you to spend multiple actions. For example, drinking a potion worn at your belt requires using an Interact action to draw it and then using a second action to drink it as described in its Activate entry (page 532)." </p>
<p>This change also removes several sorts of "container" items from the tables on 286-292, as they are no longer tracked separately from the items they store. These are: </p>
<ul>
<li>bandolier</li>
<li>belt pouch</li>

<p>You can make a set of tools (such as alchemist’s tools or healer’s tools) easier to use by wearing it. This allows you to draw and replace the tools as part of the action that uses them. You can wear up to 2 Bulk of tools in this manner; tools beyond this limit must be stowed or drawn with an Interact action to use." Fine clothing reduces that limit to light Bulk worth of tools.</p>

You delve into the possible futures of the next few seconds to understand all the ways your foe might avoid harm, then cast out a vision of that future to your allies. Designate a creature. The first time each target makes an attack roll against that creature during true target’s duration, the attacker rolls twice and uses the better result.

<p>Attack Rolls. There was some confusion as to whether skill checks with the attack trait (such as Grapple or Trip) are also attack rolls at the same time. They are not. To make this clear,  add this sentence to the beginning of the definition of attack roll "When you use a Strike action or make a spell attack, you attempt a check called an attack roll." </p>
<p>To clarify the different rules elements involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <strong>attack</strong> is any check that has the <strong>attack trait</strong>. It applies and increases the multiple attack penalty.</li>
<li>An <strong>attack roll</strong> is one of the core types of checks in the game (along with saving throws, skill checks, and Perception checks). They are used for Strikes and spell attacks, and traditionally target Armor Class.</li>
<li>Some skill actions have the <strong>attack trait</strong>, specifically Athletics actions such as Grapple and Trip. You still make a skill check with these skills, not an attack roll.</li>
<li>The <strong>multiple attack penalty</strong> applies on those skill actions as well. As it says later on in the definition of attack roll "Striking multiple times in a turn has diminishing returns. The multiple attack penalty (detailed on page 446) applies to each attack after the first, whether those attacks are Strikes, special attacks like the Grapple action of the Athletics skill, or spell attack rolls." There is inaccurate language in the Multiple Attack Penalty section implying it applies only to attack rolls that will be receiving errata.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="page-451">Page 451:<a class="headerlink" href="#page-451" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h6>
<p>Following the formulas for calculating damage rolls, add the sentence “If the combined penalties on an attack would reduce the damage to 0 or below, you still deal 1 damage.” Resistances and the like can still reduce the damage to 0.</p>
<h6 id="page-452">Page 452:<a class="headerlink" href="#page-452" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h6>

<p>Weaknesses like "salt" and "water" weren't fully explained. At the beginning of the second paragraph in weakness, add "If you have a weakness to something that doesn’t normally deal damage, such as water, you take damage equal to the weakness value when touched or affected by it."</p>
<h6 id="page-453-and-634">Page 453 and 634:<a class="headerlink" href="#page-453-and-634" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h6>
<p>In Nonlethal Attacks, nonlethal effects other than Strikes weren't explained directly, so at the end add "Spells and other effects with the nonlethal trait that reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points knock the creature out instead of killing them" On page 634, add the nonlethal trait "An effect with this trait is nonlethal. Damage from a nonlethal effect knocks a creature out rather than killing it."</p>

<p>In the Emanation section, add the following sentence to the end. “Unless the text states otherwise, the creature creating an emanation effect chooses whether the creature at its center is affected.” This means that you can cast spells like harm without damaging yourself.</p>

<p>In the first bullet point under Knocked Out and Dying, change the sentence to “You immediately move your initiative position to directly before the turn in which you were reduced to 0 HP.” This was originally intended, and prevents weird situations where you are knocked out by a reaction and die without having a chance for your allies to help you.</p>

You lose the dying condition entirely and stabilize with 0 Hit Points. You don’t gain the wounded condition or increase its value from losing the dying condition in this way, but if you already had that condition, you don’t lose it or decrease its value.” </p>
<h6 id="page-461">Page 461:<a class="headerlink" href="#page-461" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h6>
<p>Add a new section after Temporary Hit Points: </p>
<p><em>Fast Healing and Regeneration</em></p>
<p>Some abilities grant fast healing, and some creatures have regeneration. A creature with either ability regains the listed amount of Hit Points each round at the beginning of its turn. A creature with regeneration has additional benefits. Its dying condition can’t increase to a value that would kill it (this stops most creatures from going beyond dying 3) as long as its regeneration is active. If it takes damage of a type listed in the regeneration entry, its regeneration deactivates until the end of its next turn, including against the triggering damage.</p>

<p>Craft Requirements. Add text about upgrading an item from a lower-level version into a higher-level version.

All other creatures within 5 feet of it take 1 acid splash damage. On a critical hit, the target takes 2 acid damage and 2d6 persistent acid damage, but the splash damage is still 1.

<p>Under the Mutagens heading, to explain how to handle the counteracting between mutagens, add the following sentence to the end of the second paragraph. “Mutagens are polymorph effects (page 301), and a subsequent polymorph effect attempts to counteract an existing effect; the counteract check for a mutagen uses the item’s level and a modifier equal to the that level’s DC – 10, as found on Table 10–5:

In preparing a staff, change the second sentence to "When you do so, that staff gains a number of charges equal to the level of your highest spell slot. You don’t need to expend any spells to add charges in this way." This makes it clear how many charges you gain if you have only a few low level spell slots but have a cantrip or focus spell. Finally, in attacking with a staff, add "Staves are also staff weapons (page 280). They can be etched with fundamental runes but not property runes. This doesn’t alter any of their spellcasting abilities." since staves are specific weapons, with the staff abilities as the additional abilities.</p>

<p>The minion and summoned traits are out of date. Change to match <em>Secrets of Magic</em>. </p>
<p>Minions are creatures that directly serve another creature. A creature with this trait can use only 2 actions per turn, doesn’t have reactions, and can’t act when it’s not your turn. Your minion acts on your turn in combat, once per turn, when you spend an action to issue it commands. For an animal companion, you Command an Animal; for a minion that’s a spell or magic item effect, like a summoned minion, you Sustain a Spell or Sustain an Activation; if not otherwise specified, you issue a verbal command as a single action with the auditory and concentrate traits. If given no commands, minions use no actions except to defend themselves or to escape obvious harm. If left unattended for long enough, typically 1 minute, mindless minions usually don’t act, animals follow their instincts, and sapient minions act how they please. A minion can’t control other creatures. </p>
<p>A creature called by a spell or effect gains the summoned trait. A summoned creature can’t summon other creatures, create things of value, or cast spells that require a cost. It has the minion trait. If it tries to Cast a Spell of equal or higher level than the spell that summoned it, it overpowers the summoning magic, causing its own spell to fail and the summon spell to end. Otherwise, the summoned creature uses the standard abilities for a creature of its kind. It generally attacks your enemies to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with it, you can attempt to command it, but the GM determines the degree to which it follows your commands.</p>
<p>Immediately when you finish Casting the Spell, the summoned creature uses its 2 actions for that turn. A spawn or other creature generated from a summoned creature returns to its unaltered state (usually a corpse in the case of spawn) once the summoned creature is gone. If it’s unclear what this state would be, the GM decides. Summoned creatures can be banished by various spells and effects. They are automatically banished if reduced to 0 Hit Points or if the spell that called them ends. </p>

<p>Ice storm and lightning storm had some issues, with potentially-intense effects limited to a way-too-small area. The big change was that they both updated the area from 5-foot radius to 20-foot radius, but there's a few adjustments to keep them on track with other similar spells with the new area. The full adjusted text is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ice Storm Spell 4</strong>    <br />
    Cold Evocation  <br />
    Traditions arcane, primal  <br />
    Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal  <br />
    Range 120 feet; Area 20-foot burst  <br />
    Saving Throw basic Reflex; Duration sustained up to 1 minute  <br />
    You create a gray storm cloud that pelts creatures with an icy deluge. When you Cast the Spell, a burst of magical hail deals 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 2d8 cold damage to each creature in the area below the cloud (basic Reflex save). Snow and sleet continue to rain down in the area for the remainder of the spell’s duration, making the area difficult terrain. Any creature that ends its turn in the storm takes 2 cold damage. If you Cast this Spell outdoors, you can create two non-overlapping clouds instead of one. As normal, if a big creature is in both clouds, it still only takes the initial damage once and the continuing damage once per turn.  <br />
<strong>Heightened</strong> (+2) The initial bludgeoning damage and cold damage increase by 1d8 each, and the cold damage creatures take at the end of their turns increases by 1.    </p>
<p><strong>**Lightning Storm Spell 5</strong>   <br />
    Electricity Evocation  <br />
    Traditions primal  <br />
    Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal  <br />
    Range 120 feet; Area 20-foot burst  <br />
    Saving Throw basic Reflex; Duration sustained up to 1 minute  <br />
    You create a black, rumbling storm cloud and call down one lightning bolt within the spell’s area. The bolt is a vertical line from the top of the storm cloud to the ground below, dealing 4d12 electricity damage to creatures in the line (basic Reflex save). On subsequent rounds, the first time you Sustain the Spell each round, you can call another lightning bolt within the area. If you Cast this Spell outdoors, you can create two non-overlapping clouds instead of one, though you can still call down only one bolt per turn.   <br />
    Heightened (+2) The damage of each bolt increases by 1d12.    </p>

The specter makes a vile touch Strike. If it damages a living creature, the specter gains 5 temporary Hit Points and the target creature must attempt a DC 24 Will save to avoid becoming corrupted.<br />
<em>Critical Success</em> The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune to spectral corruption for 1 minute.<br />
<em>Success</em> The creature is stupefied 2 for 1 hour.<br />
<em>Failure</em> The creature succumbs to the corruption and becomes a spectral thrall temporarily. The creature is controlled by the specter, obeying the specter's telepathic or spoken orders, though a spectral thrall does not obey obviously self-destructive orders. This lasts until the end of the thrall’s next turn, at which point it is no longer controlled but becomes stupefied 2 for 1 hour. <br />
<em>Critical Failure</em> As failure, but the duration is unlimited. The thrall can attempt a new Will save at the end of each of its turns; on a success, it is no longer controlled by the specter but becomes stupefied 2 for 1 hour.   </p>

Your spider legs can't perform actions that require fingers or significant manual dexterity, including any action that would require a check to accomplish. The GM might determine other manipulate actions are appropriate for your spider legs"</p>

<p>What actions qualify for the requirements of the resonant weapon trait's Conduct Energy action?</p>
<ul>
<li>You can only use Conduct Energy with actions that have one of the required energy traits. Using an action other than a spell that causes damage with the listed trait does not necessarily qualify unless the action also has the trait.</li>
<li>For example, if you used the ifrit's Scorching Disarm action, you could channel fire energy into your weapon via Conduct Energy, as Scorching Disarm itself has the fire trait.</li>
<li>However, if you made a Strike with a flaming weapon, the Strike action does not have the fire trait, so you couldn't use Conduct Energy. </li>
