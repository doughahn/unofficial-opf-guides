<h4 id="updated-terminology">Updated Terminology<a class="headerlink" href="#updated-terminology" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h4>
<p>Several ability names changed slightly between the Pathfinder Playtest and the final Pathfinder Core Rulebook, and while we tried to catch them all, we missed a few. Make the changes as noted below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Page 57: Adaptive Adept: Change “Adapted Spell” to “Adapted Cantrip”</li>
<li>Page 62: field medic background: Change “Battle Medic” to “Battle Medicine”</li>
<li>Page 75: perpetual infusions (bomber option): Change “lesser liquid ice” to “lesser frost vial”</li>
<li>Page 91: Thrash: Change “ferocious specialization” to “weapon specialization”</li>
<li>Page 115: Instrument of Zeal: Change “Smite Evil” to “Blade of Justice”</li>
<li>Page 139: Primal Wellspring: Change “Wild Focus” to “Primal Focus”</li>
<li>Page 156: mystic strikes class feature: Change “handwraps of mighty fists” to “handwraps of mighty blows”</li>
<li>Page 168: class features: Change “weapon expertise (ranger only)” to “ranger weapon expertise”</li>
<li>Page 198 (undead bloodline), Page 405: Change “touch of undeath (sorcerer)” to “undeath’s blessing”</li>
<li>Page 206 sidebar, Page 349: (magic aura): Change “study aura” to “read aura”</li>
<li>Page 212: Clever Counterspell: Change “Quick Recognize” to “Quick Recognition”</li>
<li>Page 397: splash of art: Change “sluggish” to “clumsy”</li>
<li>Page 594: greater staff of necromancy (4th level): Change “enervation” to “vampiric touch”</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="errata">Errata<a class="headerlink" href="#errata" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Page 35: Add to sidebar: Clan Dagger You get one clan dagger of your clan for free, as it was given to you at birth. Selling this clan dagger is a terrible taboo and earns you the disdain of other dwarves.</li>
<li>Page 37: In Mountain’s Stoutness, change the third sentence to “When you have the dying condition, the DC of your recovery checks is equal to 9 + your dying value (instead of 10 + your dying value).” Change the second paragraph to “If you also have the Toughness feat, the Hit Points gained from it and this feat are cumulative, and the DC of your recovery checks is equal to 6 + your dying value.” </li>
<li>Page 41: Universal Longevity: Change “Elven Longevity” to “Ancestral Longevity”</li>
<li>Page 44: Gnome Weapon Familiarity grants access to kukris as well as all uncommon gnome weapons. Change the first sentence of the second paragraph to “In addition, you gain access to kukris and all uncommon gnome weapons.” </li>
<li>Page 52 and 59: Halfling and Orc Weapon Familiarity has the wrong language for how to treat weapons with the halfling or orc trait; all ancestries with Weapon Familiarity should only treat the weapons as a different category for the purpose of determining proficiency. Change the final sentence to "For the purpose of determining your proficiency, martial halfling/orc weapons are simple weapons and advanced halfling/orc weapons are martial weapons."</li>
<li>Page 55: Humans are supposed to have one more language. Change the additional languages to "1 + your Intelligence modifier."</li>

<ul>
<li>Any class feature that improves the proficiency rank or grants the critical specialization effect access for simple weapons or a specific set of weapons, that ability also grants that benefit for unarmed attacks.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>All three of these abilities grant a two-tier benefit on a failed saving throw of the specified type, but (as always) no ability will ever change your degree of success by more than one step. To clarify, we’re making the following clarification to all three abilities. Change the beginning of the last sentence from “When you fail” a given saving throw to “When you roll a failure on” a giving saving throw. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Page 73: In the alchemist's Chirurgeon section, change “lesser elixir of life” to “minor elixir of life.” The lesser elixir of life is a 3rd-level item that a 1st-level character can’t create.</p>
</li>
<li>In the Mutagenist section, remove the second paragraph, which provides an obsolete benefit. Replace it with the following free action.<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mutagenic Flashback [free-action]</strong><br />
    Alchemist, Manipulate<br />
    Frequency once per day<br />
    You experience a brief resurgence of a mutagen. Choose one mutagen you’ve consumed since your last daily preparations. You gain the effects of that mutagen for 1 minute.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Pages 75, 79, and 81: Several alchemist class feats reference benefits for alchemical items “you created,” which isn’t relevant in the wider rule set. Remove “you created” from Feral Mutagen, Elastic Mutagen, Invincible Mutagen, Expanded Splash, Genius Mutagen, Persistent Mutagen, and Mindblank Mutagen.
Page 79: In the alchemist's Merciful Elixir class feat, add to the end of the last sentence “using the item’s level and a counteract modifier equal to your class DC – 10.” to define the counteract modifier.</li>
<li>Page 81: In the alchemist's Improbable Elixirs class feature, change the third and fourth sentences to read “You gain formulas to create these potions as alchemical items with the elixir trait. When making these alchemical elixirs, you can substitute alchemical reagents for an equal value of magical components, and you can use alchemist’s tools (for Quick Alchemy) or an alchemist’s lab (for the Craft activity) instead of any other required tool kits.”</li>
<li>Page 85: In the barbarian's greater juggernaut class feature, change the last sentence to read “When you roll a failure on a Fortitude save against an effect that deals damage, you halve the damage you take.” This removes confusion about how to handle critical failures on saves against damaging effects.</li>
<li>Page 86: In Table 3–3: Animal Instincts, change the deer’s Damage entry to 1d10 P and replace the “charge” trait with the “grapple” trait.</li>
<li>Page 87: In the barbarian's Titan Mauler (Instinct Ability), change “You gain access to a weapon one size larger than you” to “You gain access to this larger weapon” This accounts for Small creatures using a weapon built for a Large creature, as stated in the previous sentence.</li>
<li>Page 90: In the barbarian's Wounded Rage class feat, remove the Rage trait.</li>
<li>Page 91: In the barbarian's Terrifying Howl class feat, change “each creature” to “each enemy.”</li>
<li>Page 93: The barbarian's Dragon Transformation class feat uses your class DC for the breath weapon at 16th and at 18th levels, rather than the DC listed for 18th level.</li>
<li>Page 93: In the barbarian's Brutal Critical class feat, change the second sentence to read “On a critical hit with a melee Strike, add one extra damage die.” </li>
<li>Pages 101–102: In the bard's Eclectic Skill class feat, change the second sentence to “Your proficiency bonus to untrained skill checks is equal to your level.” This matches the language of the Untrained Improvisation general feat and removes any ambiguity as to whether they combine.</li>
<li>Page 103: Remove the Requirement in the bard's Effortless Concentration to match all the other Effortless Concentration feats.</li>
<li>Page 108: In the champion's Deific Weapon class feature, change the second sentence to read “If it’s an unarmed attack with a d4 damage die or a simple weapon, increase the damage die by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12).</li>
<li>Page 108: In the champion's Divine Ally feat, change the first three sentences to read “A spirit of battle dwells within your armaments. Select one weapon or handwraps of mighty blows when you make your daily preparations. In your hands, the item gains the effect of a property rune.” This supports champions with a deity that has an unarmed attack as a favored weapon.</li>
<li>Page 112: Add tenets of good to the Prerequisites of Smite Evil. We accidentally omitted it.</li>
<li>Page 113: Blade of Justice should not be limited to paladins only. Remove the paladin prerequisite from Blade of Justice, and the last sentence becomes "Whether or not the target is evil, you can convert all the physical damage from the attack into good damage, and if you are a paladin, the Strike applies all effects that normally apply on a Retributive Strike (such as divine smite)."</li>
<li>Page 121: Deadly Simplicity had a benefit for unarmed attack favored weapons, but such clerics did not actually qualify. Change the prerequisites to add unarmed attacks.</li>
<li>Several classes were accidentally missing an important limitation for 10th level spells. In the following class features, add “You can’t use this spell slot for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or that give you more spell slots.”</li>
<li>Page 121: Miraculous Spell</li>
<li>Page 133: Primal Hierophant </li>
<li>Page 207: Archwizard's Spellcraft</li>
<li>Page 125: Emblazon Antimagic has the wrong counteract level. Change it to "your counteract level is equal to half your level, rounded up"</li>
<li>Page 129: Druid mistakenly was trained in a class DC, when it shouldn't have a class DC. Remove it.</li>
<li>Page 132: In Table 3–11: Druid Spells per Day, change the Cantrips entry at each level from 4 to 5, just like other spellcasters.</li>
<li>Page 135: Remove the “one-action” glyph from the druid's Poison Resistance class feat. This benefit is perpetual.</li>
<li>Page 138: In Plant Shape, the level of the plant form spell if you don't have Wild Shape wasn't clear. It should say it's " heightened to the same level as your highest druid spell slot"</li>
<li>Page 139: Hierophant's Power wasn't supposed to have the prerequisite of legendary in Nature; it's a holdover from the playtest. Remove the prerequisite.</li>
<li>Page 145: The adjustment to the Aid reaction after the playtest caused Assisting Shot not to do anything. </li>
<li>Replace it with this version. <blockquote>
<p><strong>Assisting Shot [one-action] Feat 2</strong> 
  Fighter, Press 
  Requirements You are wielding a ranged weapon. 
  With a quick shot, you interfere with a foe in combat. Make a Strike with a ranged weapon. If the strike hits, the next creature other than you to attack the same target before the start of your next turn gains a +1 circumstance bonus on their roll, or a +2 circumstance bonus if your Strike was a critical hit. </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Page 151: In the fighter's Incredible Ricochet class feat, the narrative of the feat involves using the first shot to help target the next shot. Change the second sentence to “Make a ranged weapon Strike against a creature you previously attacked this turn.”</li>
<li>Page 152: Determination has the wrong counteract level. Change it to "your counteract level is equal to half your level, rounded up"
Page 156: In the monk's Powerful Fist class feature, in the second sentence replace “changes” with “increases” to make it clear the normal rules on increases to die sizes apply.</li>
<li>Page 157: In the monk's Key Terms sidebar, under the Ki Spells entry, add “and your key spellcasting ability is Wisdom” to the end of the second paragraph.</li>
<li>Pages 159 and 163: In the monk's Mountain Stance and Tangled Forest Stance class feats, change the “Trigger” heading to “Requirements.” The content of each entry remains the same.</li>
<li>Page 163: Sleeper Hold shouldn't have the attack trait, meaning it doesn't apply or increase your multiple attack penalty.</li>
<li>Page 164: Change the action glyph for the monk's Stance Savant class feat to [free-action] instead of [reaction].</li>
<li>Page 165: Master of Many Styles lists "Your turn begins" as a requirement, but it should be a trigger. Change it to a trigger. </li>
<li>Page 169: In the ranger's nature’s edge class feature, remove “on natural uneven ground” as it's redundant. </li>
<li>Page 172: Change the action glyph for the ranger's Disrupt Prey class feat to [reaction] instead of [free-action].</li>
<li>Page 174: In the ranger's Terrain Master class feat, remove “wild stride” from the Prerequisites entry.</li>
<li>Page 175: In the ranger's Lightning Snares class feat, add “Quick Snares” to the Prerequisites entry.</li>
<li>Page 176: In the ranger's Stealthy Companion class feat, add “Animal Companion” to the Prerequisites entry.</li>
<li>Page 177: In order to make it completely clear how the Manifold Edge feat works, change the second sentence to read "When you use Hunt Prey, you can gain a hunter’s edge benefit other than the one you selected at 1st level." With the previous wording, a few people thought you gained both benefits, rather than a substitution.</li>
<li>Page 184: In the rogue's Minor Magic class feat, add the following sentence. “Your key spellcasting ability is Charisma, and you’re trained in spell attack rolls and DCs for the tradition of your chosen cantrips.”</li>
<li>Page 185: In the rogue's Poison Weapon class feat, if you're already holding the poison, you shouldn't need a free hand. Remove “and have a free hand” from the Requirements and remove “and have a free hand” from the Requirements entry and change the first sentence to read “You apply a poison to the required weapon; if you’re not holding a poison and have a free hand, you can Interact to draw a poison as part of this action.”</li>
<li>Page 188: Blank Slate, like a few other entries, was still erroneously running on a level 1 to 20 scale for counteract levels. Replace "counteract level of 20" with "counteract level of 10."</li>
<li>189: Dispelling Slice should use the default counteract level of "half your level (rounded up)", in the final sentence. </li>
<li>Page 194: Add the following sorcerer class feature at 17th level:</li>
<li>Resolve<blockquote>
<p><strong>Resolve</strong> 
You’ve steeled you mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increase to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Page 197: In the sorcerer's Elemental Type section of the elemental bloodline, change the last sentence to read “Replace any existing elemental traits with the trait of the element you chose.”</li>
<li>Page 199: In the Sorcerer Feats sidebar, change the level of “Bespell Weapon” from 6 to 4 to match the feat itself.</li>
<li>Page 201: Remove the arcane trait from Greater Mental Evolution and the divine trait from Greater Vital Evolution, both sorcerer class feats.</li>
<li>Pages 204 and 206: Wizards gain their first class feat at 2nd level, like other spellcasters. On page 204, in Table 3-18: Wizard Advancement, remove “wizard feat” from the 1st-level entry. On page 206, in the Wizard Feats section, change the first sentence to “At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a wizard class feat.”</li>
<li>Page 205: In Drain Bonded Item, remove the unnecessary Requirement of "Your turn begins."</li>
<li>Page 214: In the first paragraph, replace the first two sentences with the following to clarify the specific action required to command your animal companion, and that it doesn’t require a check. </li>
<li>Replace with:<blockquote>
<p>An animal companion is a loyal comrade who follows your orders. Your animal companion has the minion trait, and it gains 2 actions during your turn if you use the Command an Animal action to command it; this is in place of the usual effects of Command an Animal, and you don’t need to attempt a Nature check."</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Page 214: Under Young Animal Companions, add the sentence “An animal companion has the same level you do.” </li>
<li>In the same paragraph, change the maximum item bonus to AC an animal companion can gain from +2 to +3. </li>
<li>Page 217: In the ambusher section, remove “It gains a +2 circumstance bonus to initiative rolls using Stealth” since a companion acts on your initiative and therefore this clause provides no benefit.</li>
<li>Page 217: Familiars' level wasn't explicit. Add "A familiar has the same level you do." The description of familiars didn't define any Strikes but also wasn't explicit that they couldn't make them. Add "It can't make Strikes" to the beginning of the third sentence.</li>
<li>Page 219: Under Spellcasting Archetypes, in the Basic Spellcasting Feat, change the second sentence to “At 6th level, they grant you a 2nd‑level spell slot, and if you have a spell repertoire, you can select one spell from your repertoire as a signature spell.” In the Expert Spellcasting Feat, after the first sentence, add “If you have a spell repertoire, you can select a second spell from your repertoire as a signature spell.” In the Master Spellcasting Feat, after the first sentence, add “If you have a spell repertoire, you can select a third spell from your repertoire as a signature spell.” </li>
<li>Spellcasting Dedication Feats (pages 222, 224, 225, and 230): In the spellcasting dedication feats, you can prepare or add to your repertoire common cantrips of your spellcasting tradition, whether from this book or other cantrips of that tradition you learn or discover. </li>
<li>Page 230: In the Sorcerer Dedication feat, replace the second sentence of the second paragraph with “You gain a spell repertoire with two common cantrips from the spell list associated with your bloodline, from the spells granted by your bloodline, or any other cantrips of that tradition you learn or discover.” This grants access to the bloodline-granted cantrips as well as those on the associated spell list. </li>
<li>Page 233: Clarifying the general rule on repeated skill training that gives you a replacement skill, add at the end of the second paragraph "though if the skill is a Lore skill, the new skill must also be a Lore skill"</li>
<li>Page 242: In Grapple, the restrained condition doesn't technically also make a creature grabbed, so to make it clear, in the requirements of the action and at the end of the first paragraph about not needing a hand if you're already grabbing someone, change "grabbed" to "grabbed or restrained"</li>
<li>Page 244: The Craft downtime activity requires an alchemist’s lab, not just alchemist’s tools. See the errata for page 287. </li>
<li>Page 248: To reflect the clarification on healer's tools allowing you to draw them as part of the action if you're wearing them, change the Requirements to "You are holding healer's tools, or you are wearing them and have a hand free"</li>
<li>Page 249: Add "Drop Prone" to the list of basic commands you can tell your animal friend to lie down.</li>
<li>Page 255: In Table 5–2: General Skill Feats, change the description of Automatic Knowledge from “once per day” to “once per round.” It was correct in the text but not the table.</li>
<li>Page 258: In Battle Medicine, change the Requirements entry to “You are holding or wearing healer's tools.” Change the second sentence of the effect to <strong>“Attempt a Medicine check with the same DC as for Treat Wounds, and restore a corresponding amount of Hit Points; this does not remove the wounded condition.”</strong> This means you need to use your healer's tools for Battle Medicine, but you can draw and replace worn tools as part of the action due to the errata on wearing tools on page 287. </li>
<li>Update: We will be updating the tools revamp to indicate that worn healer's tools (along with other tool kits) take only one hand to use, as you don't have to hold the whole kit in your other hand, just pull out the things you need. What this means for Battle Medicine is that you only need one free hand to perform it with worn healer's tools, you don't need both hands. </li>
<li>Page 259: Bonded Animal didn't explain the logistics of bonding the animal directly, leading a small number of people to be unsure that it was necessary to locate and interact with the animal to bond with it. To make it explicit, change the second sentence to "You can spend 7 days of downtime regularly interacting with a normal animal (…) that is friendly or helpful to you."</li>
<li>Page 260: The Cloud Jump feat referred to exceeding a "limit" without spelling out exactly which limit. It's supposed to be the limit of not being able to Leap farther than your Speed. To make it clear, change the second paragraph to read "You can jump a distance greater than your Speed by spending additional actions when you Long Jump or High Jump. For each additional action spent, add your Speed to the limit on how far you can Leap." As an example, supposing you had a Speed of 40 feet and 25 on your Athletics check, Cloud Jump triples the 25 feet to 75 feet, but the limit of 40 feet still applies so you would jump 40 feet. If you spent another action, the limit based on your Speed would raise from 40 feet to 80 feet, so you would jump 75 feet.</li>
<li>Page 260: The Connections feat requires a great deal of improvisation and adjudication on the part of a GM, more in line with an option that has uncommon rarity due to the narrative load. Because of this, change the feat's rarity to uncommon.
Page 260: Dubious Knowledge's effect should only happen on a failure, not a critical failure. Change the effect to explicitly state it doesn't occur on a critical failure.</li>
<li>Page 268: Because the word "action" could have broad or narrow scopes, it wasn't clear exactly when you could use the Unified Theory feat to substitute Arcana for the other magical skills. Change the beginning of the second sentence to "Whenever you use a skill action or a skill feat" to make it clear you can use it with skill actions (such as the ones in Chapter 4) and skill feat, but not for other actions, such as when casting spells or rituals.</li>
<li>Page 268: In Toughness, change the last sentence to read “The DC of recovery checks is equal to 9 + your dying condition value (page 459).” </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="held-worn-and-stowed-items">Held, Worn, and Stowed Items<a class="headerlink" href="#held-worn-and-stowed-items" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Page 271: We've simplified the way we're handling characters carrying their gear so that you can define all your carried items in one of three categories. Replace the carrying and using items section with this text: "A character carries items in three ways: held, worn, and stowed. Held items are in your hands; a character typically has two hands, allowing them to hold an item in each hand or a single two-handed item using both hands. Worn items are tucked into pockets, belt pouches, bandoliers, weapon sheaths, and so forth, and they can be retrieved and returned relatively quickly. Stowed items are in a backpack or a similar container, and they are more difficult to access. Drawing a worn item or changing how you’re carrying an item usually requires you to use an Interact action (though to drop an item, you use the Release action instead). Table 6–2: Changing Equipment on page 273 lists some ways that you might change the items you’re holding or carrying, and the number of hands you need to do so. Many ways of using items require you to spend multiple actions. For example, drinking a potion worn at your belt requires using an Interact action to draw it and then using a second action to drink it as described in its Activate entry (page 532)." </li>
<li>This change also removes several sorts of "container" items from the tables on 286-292, as they are no longer tracked separately from the items they store. These are: </li>
<li>bandolier</li>
<li>belt pouch</li>
<li>satchel</li>
<li>scroll case </li>
<li>sheath</li>
<li>vial </li>
<li>Page 287 adds a paragraph on Wearing Tools: "You can make a set of tools (such as alchemist’s tools or healer’s tools) easier to use by wearing it. This allows you to draw and replace the tools as part of the action that uses them. You can wear up to 2 Bulk of tools in this manner; tools beyond this limit must be stowed or drawn with an Interact action to use." Fine clothing reduces that limit to light Bulk worth of tools.</li>
<li>Update: Worn tools should only take 1 hand to use, as you only draw the things you need from the kit and not the entire kit. This has been marked for future errata.</li>
<li>Page 275: Under the Armor Traits heading, change the entry for Noisy to “Noisy: This armor is loud and likely to alert others to your presence. The armor’s check penalty applies to Stealth checks even if you meet the required Strength score.” </li>
<li>Page 278: Under Improvised Weapons, add the sentence “Improvised weapons are simple weapons.” This dictates the proficiency modifier you use. </li>
<li>Page 278: In critical hits, "When you make an attack and roll a natural 20...or if the result of your attack exceeds the target's AC by 10" was too broad a brush and thus slightly inaccurate for how to determine a critical hit, in an attempt to state the conditions succinctly. Replace the first section with "When you make an attack and succeed with a natural 20" so that's it's clear the natural 20 must succeed based on the total result in order to get a critical success.</li>
<li>Page 280: Under the Ammunition heading, add the sentence “Using ammunition destroys it.” </li>
<li>Page 283: Weapon traits.</li>
<li>In the definition of the Parry weapon trait, change "spend an Interact action" to "spend a single action" to make it so setting up a parry doesn't trigger Attacks of Opportunity or similar reactions.</li>
<li>In the definition for the thrown weapon trait, change the first sentence to “You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack, and it is a ranged weapon when thrown.” </li>
<li>In the definition for the unarmed weapon trait, the sentence "a fist or other grasping appendage follows the same rules as a free-hand weapon" was worded in such a way it confused a few people, who thought that meant those unarmed attacks were weapons, despite statements to the contrary on page 278. To make it clear, change that section to read "a fist or other grasping appendage generally works like a free-hand weapon"</li>
<li>Page 283: In Critical Specialization Effects, it uses the generic term attack but should specifically refer to Strikes. In the first sentence, change "when you make an attack with certain weapons" to "when you make a Strike with certain weapons"</li>
<li>Page 288: Change the price of the the adventurer's pack to 15 sp and the bedroll to 2 cp.</li>
<li>Page 289: Due to other changes (particularly the adventurer's pack, which was in all of the kits), the Bulk and cost of all of the class kits have changed. All kits are included in full in this entry so you don't have to cross-reference two places to use them.</li>
<li>Alchemist Class Kit:<ul>
<li>Price 8 gp, 4 sp, 2 cp; Bulk 3 Bulk, 7 light;</li>

<li>Page 293: Under Consumable Magic Items, change holy water to deal “1d6 good damage and 1 good splash damage.” Change unholy water to deal “1d6 evil damage and 1 evil splash damage” instead of “1d6 good damage.” </li>

<h4 id="changes-to-make-bulk-less-restrictive">Changes to Make Bulk Less Restrictive<a class="headerlink" href="#changes-to-make-bulk-less-restrictive" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h4>
<p>The following changes make Bulk limits less restrictive for your character. </p>
<ul>
<li>Page 287: Add the following entry for an alchemist’s lab: 
Alchemist’s Lab: You need an alchemist’s lab to Craft alchemical items during downtime. An expanded alchemist’s lab gives a +1 item bonus to Crafting checks to create alchemical items. </li>
<li>Page 287: Amend the Alchemist’s Tools entry to the following: 
Alchemist’s Tools: This mobile collection of vials and chemicals can be used for simple alchemical tasks. </li>
<li>Page 287: In the Backpack description, add this sentence: “The first 2 Bulk of items in your backpack don’t count against your Bulk limits.” Similarly "The first 1 Bulk of items in each saddlebag doesn't count against your mount's Bulk limits."</li>
<li>Page 288: Make the following changes on Table 6–9: Adventuring Gear. </li>
<li>Change the Bulk of the adventurer’s pack from 2 to 1. </li>
<li>Change the Bulk of formula book (blank) and spellbook (blank) from 1 to L </li>
<li>Add “Alchemist’s Lab” (Price 5 gp, Bulk 6, Hands 2) </li>
<li>Change “Expanded Alchemist’s Tools (level 3)” to “Expanded Alchemist’s Lab” as a sub-entry to the new alchemist’s lab, and change the Bulk from 1 to 6 </li>
<li>Change the alchemist’s tools Price from 5 gp to 3 gp, and the Bulk from 2 to 1 </li>
<li>Page 292: The waterskin is always light Bulk, whether full or empty. </li>
<li>Page 300: The text on cantrips was confusing and implied that they might use spell slots, even though they don't. Change the second to last sentence in the first paragraph to "If you're a prepared spellcaster, you can prepare a specific number of cantrips each day. You can't prepare a cantrip in a spell slot."</li>
<li>Page 303: In the Component Substitutions sidebar, replace the second paragraph with the following to avoid implying changes to action traits. </li>
<li>Replace with:<blockquote>
<p>If you’re a bard Casting a Spell from the occult tradition, you can usually play an instrument for spells requiring somatic or material components, as long as it takes at least one of your hands to do so. If you use an instrument, you don’t need a spell component pouch or another hand free. You can usually also play an instrument for spells requiring verbal components, instead of speaking.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Also add a final one-sentence paragraph covering innate spells: <blockquote>
<p>Any character casting an innate spell can replace any material component with a somatic component.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Pages 316–407: Remove the attack trait from the spells Abyssal plague, chill touch, death knell, ghoulish cravings, goblin pox, mariner’s curse, outcast’s curse, spider sting, spiritual guardian, spiritual weapon, savor the sting, touch of undeath (the cleric focus spell), and force bolt. </li>
<li>Pages 316-407 and 573: Damaging spells and items meant to harm PCs do way too much damage for your gear to survive if it could be targeted, so such spells almost never are supposed to be able to damage objects. A few target lines slipped by with "creatures or objects." Remove the ability to target or damage objects from <em>acid splash, acid arrow, eclipse burst, polar ray, sunburst, fire ray, moon beam, force bolt</em>, and the <em>horn of blasting</em>. Limit <em>hydraulic push</em> to "creatures and unattended objects."</li>
<li>Page 318: In <em>animal messenger</em>, change the duration to “see text.” Change the spell description to state that the spell ends after 24 hours or when a creature removes the attached object, whichever happens first. </li>
<li>Page 318 and 400: In <em>antimagic field</em> and storm lord, you can't exclude yourself from the emanation as you can for many other emanations, so change the area to explicitly states "which affects you."</li>
<li>Pages 322 and 390: In the success entries for <em>charm</em> (page 322) and charming touch (page 390), replace references to Identify Magic with a reference to the Identifying Spells section on page 305. </li>
<li>Page 330, 358, 377: Add the attack trait to <em>disintegrate, polar ray</em>, and <em>tanglefoot</em>. </li>
<li>Page 331: Add the cantrip trait to <em>disrupt undead</em>. </li>
<li>Page 336: In <em>enlarge</em>, change the Heightened (6th) entry to read “Choose either the 2nd-level or 4th-level version of this spell and apply its effects to 10 willing creatures.” in case you want to make a large number of creatures Large but Huge would be too big for your circumstances.</li>
<li>Page 338, 346, 379, 400: Several sustained spells are meant to provide once per turn benefits when they are sustained, not be used multiple times per turn. In <em>flaming sphere, implosion, unfathomable song, impaling briars</em>, and <em>storm lord</em> add "the first time you Sustain this Spell each round" </li>
<li>Page 339: Once <em>flesh to stone</em> has completely petrified you, the spell ends but you still remain petrified, meaning you can't remove the effects with dispel magic or similar abilities that counteract active spells; you need stone to flesh. Change the last two sentences of the failure condition to read "When a creature is unable to act due to the slowed condition from flesh to stone, the creature is permanently non-magically petrified. The spell ends if the creature is petrified or the slowed condition is removed."</li>
<li>Page 343: In <em>harm</em>, change the description of the 3-action version to read “you disperse negative energy” instead of positive energy. </li>
<li>Page 343: Even if you aren't a humanoid, you too can be a hero. In heroism, remove "humanoid" from the targets line so it just reads "1 creature"</li>
<li>Page 345: <em>Illusory disguise</em>, a Perception check to disbelieve just happens, it isn't a free action, so change "attempt a Perception check to disbelieve the spell as a free action" to read "attempt an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the spell."</li>
<li>Page 348: In <em>light</em>, change the Targets entry to read “1 object of 1 Bulk or less, either unattended or possessed by you or a willing ally” </li>
<li>Page 349: Some corner cases in <em>magic fang</em> and <em>magic weapon</em>. In magic fang, change the Targets entry to “1 willing creature.” Change the first sentence to “Choose one of the target’s unarmed attacks.” Change the last sentence to “The unarmed attack becomes a +1 striking unarmed attack, gaining a +1 item bonus to attack rolls and increasing the number of damage dice to two if it had only one.” This makes the spell less restrictive and more versatile. In magic weapon change the Targets entry to remove the word "nonmagical" so you can still cast it on a +1 weapon to get the extra striking die.</li>
<li>Page 358: Polar ray left out what happened on a critical hit with your spell attack roll. It should double the damage (but not the drained value) on a critical hit.</li>
<li>Page 362: Purple worm sting used to have both a spell attack roll and a Fortitude save, but in changing to only a save, some of the damage is now automatic and should be reduced. Reduce the piercing damage automatically taken from the spell to 3d6.</li>
<li>Page 363: The <em>regenerate</em> spell had an incorrect interaction with the doomed condition that would cause a doomed character to still die while regenerating. To handle that, instead of preventing a creature from progressing to dying 3, change it to "its dying condition can't increase to a value that would kill it (this stops most creatures from going beyond dying 3)."</li>
<li>Page 370: In <em>sound burst</em>, change the critical failure entry to read “The creature takes double damage, is deafened for 1 minute, and is stunned 1.” since stunned doesn't have a duration.</li>
<li>Page 373: In <em>spiritual weapon</em>, you might not have a deity, particularly if you're an occult caster, so change it to manifest a "a club, a dagger, or your deity's favored weapon."</li>
<li>Page 377: <em>Telekinetic haul</em> should work only on unattended objects, not objects in creatures' possessions.</li>
<li>Page 377: In <em>telekinetic projectile</em>, change the second sentence to read “Make a spell attack roll against the target.” It was accidentally missing the word "spell" before, meaning the attack roll wasn't explicitly classified as weapon, unarmed, or spell.</li>
<li>Page 377: In tangling creepers, instead of having the creepers make an unarmed attack using your spell attack modifier, change it to just say "Make a melee spell attack roll against the target."</li>
<li>Page 379: In true target, the way the spell used its targets was confusing, and it wasn't clear it applied to more attacks. There are several changes to make this clear; </li>
<li>Here is the final text with changes in bold:<blockquote>
<p><strong>TRUE TARGET SPELL 7</strong> 
  DIVINATION FORTUNE PREDICTION 
  Traditions arcane, occult 
  Cast [one-action] verbal 
  Range 60 feet; Targets 4 creatures 
  Duration until the start of your next turn 
  You delve into the possible futures of the next few seconds to understand all the ways your foe might avoid harm, then cast out a vision of that future to your allies. Designate a creature. The first time each target makes an attack roll against that creature during true target’s duration, the attacker rolls twice and uses the better result. The attacker also ignores circumstance penalties to the attack roll and any flat check required due to the designated creature being concealed or hidden. </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Page 381: In visions of danger, there's no description of what the Will save does, other than the critical success allowing you to disbelieve. It should be a basic Will save against the mental damage.</li>
<li>Page 385: In zealous conviction, add the emotion and mental traits.</li>
<li>Page 390: In charming touch, remove "humanoid" from the target line so you can charm any kind of creature that could find you attractive.</li>
<li>Page 391: In death’s call, replace “your Wisdom modifier” with “your spellcasting ability modifier” so that champions aren't forced to use Wisdom.</li>
<li>Page 393: In healer's blessing, boost the additional healing from the base spell from 1 to 2.</li>
<li>Page 399: Replace the existing goodberry focus spell with the following. </li>
<li>New Text:<blockquote>
<p><strong>GOODBERRY FOCUS 1</strong> 
   Uncommon, Druid, Healing, Necromancy 
   Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal<br />
   Range touch; Targets 1 ripe berry<br />
   Duration 10 minutes<br />
  You imbue the target berry with the bounty of nature, turning it into a goodberry that can heal and sustain far beyond its normal capacity. A creature can eat the goodberry with an Interact action to regain 1d6+4 Hit Points. A berry not consumed during the duration withers away. Every six goodberries consumed gives as much nourishment as one square meal for a typical human.<br />
<strong>Heightened</strong> (+1) You can target an additional berry. A creature can consume any number of goodberries from the same casting with a single Interact action. </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Page 403: Angelic halo should scale based on the level of the heal spell, not based on angelic halo's level. Remove the heightened entry and instead, replace the status bonus to healing from the spell with "Allies in your halo’s emanation who are healed by a heal spell gain a status bonus to Hit Points regained equal to double the heal spell’s level."</li>
<li>Page 409: In the atone ritual, change the Heightened entry to “Heightened (+1).” </li>
<li>Page 438: Under Desna, change “3rd: dream message” to “4th: fly.” </li>
<li>Page 438: Under Iomedae, change “2nd: see invisibility” to “2nd: enlarge.” </li>
<li>Page 441: Add to the Whispering Way “Follower Alignments LE, NE, CE” </li>
<li>Page 446: Attack Rolls. There was some confusion as to whether skill checks with the attack trait (such as Grapple or Trip) are also attack rolls at the same time. They are not. To make this clear, add this sentence to the beginning of the definition of attack roll "When you use a Strike action or make a spell attack, you attempt a check called an attack roll." </li>
<li>To clarify the different rules elements involved:<ul>
<li>An <strong>attack</strong> is any check that has the <strong>attack trait</strong>. It applies and increases the multiple attack penalty.</li>
<li>An <strong>attack roll</strong> is one of the core types of checks in the game (along with saving throws, skill checks, and Perception checks). They are used for Strikes and spell attacks, and traditionally target Armor Class.</li>
<li>Some skill actions have the <strong>attack trait</strong>, specifically Athletics actions such as Grapple and Trip. You still make a skill check with these skills, not an attack roll.</li>
<li>The <strong>multiple attack penalty</strong> applies on those skill actions as well. As it says later on in the definition of attack roll "Striking multiple times in a turn has diminishing returns. The multiple attack penalty (detailed on page 446) applies to each attack after the first, whether those attacks are Strikes, special attacks like the Grapple action of the Athletics skill, or spell attack rolls." There is inaccurate language in the Multiple Attack Penalty section implying it applies only to attack rolls that will be receiving errata.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Page 451: Following the formulas for calculating damage rolls, add the sentence “If the combined penalties on an attack would reduce the damage to 0 or below, you still deal 1 damage.” Resistances and the like can still reduce the damage to 0.</li>
<li>Page 452: At the end of the description of bleed damage, add "Bleed damage ends automatically if you’re healed to your full Hit Points."</li>
<li>Page 453: Weaknesses like "salt" and "water" weren't fully explained. At the beginning of the second paragraph in weakness, add "If you have a weakness to something that doesn’t normally deal damage, such as water, you take damage equal to the weakness value when touched or affected by it."</li>
<li>Page 453 and 634: In Nonlethal Attacks, nonlethal effects other than Strikes weren't explained directly, so at the end add "Spells and other effects with the nonlethal trait that reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points knock the creature out instead of killing them" On page 634, add the nonlethal trait "An effect with this trait is nonlethal. Damage from a nonlethal effect knocks a creature out rather than killing it."</li>
<li>Page 457: In the Emanation section, add the following sentence to the end. “Unless the text states otherwise, the creature creating an emanation effect chooses whether the creature at its center is affected.” This means that you can cast spells like harm without damaging yourself.</li>
<li>Page 459: In the first bullet point under Knocked Out and Dying, change the sentence to “You immediately move your initiative position to directly before the turn in which you were reduced to 0 HP.” This was originally intended, and prevents weird situations where you are knocked out by a reaction and die without having a chance for your allies to help you.</li>
<li>Page 460: Under Heroic Recovery, replace the first sentence with the following to align with other places in the text that discuss spending Hero Points. “If you have at least 1 Hero Point (page 467), you can spend all of your remaining Hero Points at the start of your turn or when your dying value would increase. You lose the dying condition entirely and stabilize with 0 Hit Points. You don’t gain the wounded condition or increase its value from losing the dying condition in this way, but if you already had that condition, you don’t lose it or decrease its value.” </li>
<li>Page 461: Add a new section after Temporary Hit Points: </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="fast-healing-and-regeneration">Fast Healing and Regeneration<a class="headerlink" href="#fast-healing-and-regeneration" title="Permanent link">⚑</a></h4>
<p>Some abilities grant fast healing, and some creatures have regeneration. A creature with either ability regains the listed amount of Hit Points each round at the beginning of its turn. A creature with regeneration has additional benefits. Its dying condition can’t increase to a value that would kill it (this stops most creatures from going beyond dying 3) as long as its regeneration is active. If it takes damage of a type listed in the regeneration entry, its regeneration deactivates until the end of its next turn, including against the triggering damage.</p>
<ul>
<li>Page 481: Retraining. It wasn't clear how long it took to retrain spells in a spell repertoire, but it should take just 1 week. Add ". Some, like changing a spell in your spell repertoire, take a week." to retraining class features.</li>
<li>Page 421: Disabling a Hazard. How to run disabling a hazard with skills other than Thievery wasn't completely clear. Add "Like using Disable a Device, using these skills to disable a trap is a 2-action activity with the same degrees of success, though the activity might have different traits determined by the GM."</li>
<li>Page 535: Craft Requirements. Add text about upgrading an item from a lower-level version into a higher-level version. "The GM might allow you to Craft a permanent item from a lower-level version of the same item as an upgrade. For example, you might upgrade a bag of holding from a type I to a type II bag, but you couldn’t upgrade a clear spindle aeon stone into an orange prism aeon stone. The cost for this upgrade is the full difference in Price between the items, and the Crafting check uses a DC for the item’s new level."</li>
<li>Page 537 and 583: Shadow and slick runes. Since a character can't actually use those runes unless they have a +1 armor first (a 5th level item), move the items from 3rd level to 5th level when they become usable (keeping the price from the original version, even though it's unusually low for a 5th level item).</li>
<li>Page 542 and 548: The true elixir of life's price is incorrect. Change it to 8,000 gp.</li>
<li>Page 544: The example in the splash trait is confusing. Replace it with this clearer version of the example "For example, if you throw a lesser acid flask and hit your target, that creature takes 1 acid damage, 1d6 persistent acid damage, and 1 acid splash damage. All other creatures within 5 feet of it take 1 acid splash damage. On a critical hit, the target takes 2 acid damage and 2d6 persistent acid damage, but the splash damage is still 1. If you miss, the target and all creatures within 5 feet take only 1 splash damage. If you critically fail, no one takes any damage."</li>
<li>Page 546: Under the Mutagens heading, to explain how to handle the counteracting between mutagens, add the following sentence to the end of the second paragraph. “Mutagens are polymorph effects (page 301), and a subsequent polymorph effect attempts to counteract an existing effect; the counteract check for a mutagen uses the item’s level and a modifier equal to the that level’s DC – 10, as found on Table 10–5: DCs by Level (page 503).” </li>
<li>Page 548: To make it clearer that elixir of life only works on living creatures due to the healing trait, change the first sentence to "Elixirs of life accelerate a living creature’s natural healing processes and immune system."</li>
<li>Page 549: Quicksilver mutagen's "ranged attack rolls" was meant to apply to ranged weapon attack rolls and ranged unarmed attack rolls, but it makes sense to apply to Dexterity-based melee attack rolls using finesse. Change "ranged attack rolls" to "Dexterity-based attack rolls."</li>
<li>Page 550: Under Method of Exposure, in the Injury section, change the first sentence to read “An injury poison is activated by applying it to a weapon or ammunition, and it affects the target of the first Strike made using the poisoned item.” This explicitly allows you to poison ammunition as well as weapons. </li>
<li>Pages 551–554: Injury poisons should require 2 actions to apply rather than 3, allowing you to draw a poison and apply it to a weapon on the same turn. Change the Activate entries for the following poisons from a [three-actions] glyph to a [two‑actions] glyph: belladonna, black adder venom, giant centipede venom, giant scorpion venom, giant wasp venom, graveroot, hunting spider venom, lethargy poison, purple worm venom, shadow essence, and wyvern poison. </li>
<li>Page 551: Deathcap powder should be held in 1 hand, like other ingested poisons, not held in 2 hands.</li>
<li>Page 566: In dispelling sliver, add “(counteract modifier +29)” to the end of the first paragraph of the effect. </li>
<li>Page 573: In the decanter of endless water, add a usage entry of 2 hands and a Bulk entry of L.</li>
<li>Page 574: Maestro's instrument should have DCs for the charm effects, DC 27 for the moderate version and DC 38 for the greater version.</li>
<li>Page 584: In the grievous rune entry for a spear, change “enfeebled” to “clumsy” to match the spear’s critical specialization effect. </li>
<li>Page 586–587: In mithral shield, change the Bulk entries for the standard-grade mithral shield and the high-grade mithral shield from “1” to “L.” </li>
<li>Page 587: Arrow-catching shield. This shield had a built in usage frequency based on being fairly fragile that worked in the playtest rules for shields, but switching from dents to HP, the shield became too easily destroyed and needs to offer more protection. Increase the basic shield statistics to Hardness 10, HP 60, BT 30 and add a frequency of once per minute on the activation.</li>
<li>Page 588: Forge warden's durability is too low. Increase its basic shield statistics to Hardness 10, HP 40, BT 20. </li>
<li>Page 592: Under Staves, change the fourth sentence to “Many staves can be found in multiple versions, with more powerful versions that contain more spells—such a staff always contains the spells of all lower-level versions, in addition to the spells listed in its own entry.” This removes the erroneous mention of holding more charges. In preparing a staff, change the second sentence to "When you do so, that staff gains a number of charges equal to the level of your highest spell slot. You don’t need to expend any spells to add charges in this way." This makes it clear how many charges you gain if you have only a few low level spell slots but have a cantrip or focus spell. Finally, in attacking with a staff, add "Staves are also staff weapons (page 280). They can be etched with fundamental runes but not property runes. This doesn’t alter any of their spellcasting abilities." since staves are specific weapons, with the staff abilities as the additional abilities.</li>
<li>Page 594: Greater staff of necromancy has enervation, a spell that's in Advanced Player's Guide instead of this book. Replace it with a 4th level vampiric touch. </li>
<li>Page 597: Wands become broken when you overcharge them and succeed at the flat check, and you need to know their statistics to Repair them. While they use the normal statistics for a thin item of their composition, it makes sense to call that out. At the end of Varying Statistics, add "A wand has the normal Hardness, BT, and HP of a thin item of its material (page 577)."</li>
<li>Page 602: In the entry for greater storm flash, add a spell DC of 38 to the end of the last sentence, as the greater form of an item should increase the DC to a competitive one for its level. </li>
<li>Page 604: Under Companion Items, replace the third sentence with “Normally these are the only items a companion can use. Other items may qualify, at the GM’s discretion, but an animal can never Activate an Item.” This makes the rules clearer than before, and allows the GM to opt into adding more items.</li>
<li>Page 612: Healer's gloves' activation was unclear as to whether it was a healing effect. Change the activation effect to the following: "You can soothe the wounds of a willing, living, adjacent creature, restoring 2d6+7 Hit Points to that creature. This is a positive healing effect. You can’t harm undead with this healing."</li>
<li>Page 618: In the definition for the broken condition, change the second sentence to “An object is broken when damage has reduced its Hit Points to equal or less than its Broken Threshold.” This matches the definition of broken on page 272 (the inconsistency before was what happened when its HP were exactly equal to the Broken Threshold). </li>
<li>Page 620, 631, and 454: In the definition of fatigued, the intention is that it prevents the exploration tactics you take while traveling or exploring an area, but you can still stop and Refocus, Treat Wounds, and so on. Change the last sentence to "You can’t use exploration activities performed while traveling, such as those on pages 479–480." </li>
<li>Pages 620–623: In the definitions for the friendly, helpful, hostile, indifferent, and unfriendly conditions, change the first sentence to read “This condition reflects a creature’s disposition toward a particular character, and only supernatural effects (like a spell) can impose these conditions on player characters.” This continues to reflect the fact that mundane skills can't influence a PC's attitude (unless the player wishes to change it to reflect the other character's persuasive ability) while allowing magic like charm to do so.</li>
<li>Page 621: The prone condition said you could Take Cover to gain cover against ranged attacks, but it should say you gain Greater Cover. When combined with still being flat-footed, it allows you to hunker down for a net of 2 more AC against ranged attacks.</li>
<li>Page 621: Persistent damage sidebar. Clarifying Assisted Recovery, at the end of the first paragraph, change the last sentence to "This allows you to attempt an extra flat check immediately, but only once per round." and add the bullet point "• The action to help might require a skill check or another roll to determine its effectiveness." Remove Administer First Aid as an example of assisted recovery, as it's a separate action. </li>

<li>Page 71: Alchemists should have proficiency in medium armor to make things easier for mutagenists who pursue higher Strength and lower Dexterity. Add training in medium armor to their initial proficiencies as well as to their 13th and 19th level armor expertise and mastery class features.</li>
<li>Page 72-79: Alchemist DC scaling is highly dependent on the feat Powerful Alchemy, so we decided to make it an automatic class feature instead to free up more feats. Add powerful alchemy to the class features at 5th level, and remove it from the list of alchemist class feats.</li>
<li>Page 73: Alchemists at low levels don't have enough reagents to make more than a very small number of items, whereas at higher levels they can make significantly more. To help make those reagents last longer at 1st through 4th levels, add a limited version of the Field Discovery class feature at 1st level. "Your research field adds a number of formulas to your formula book; these are your signature items. When using a batch of infused reagents to create your signature items using advanced alchemy, you create three items instead of two. Each time you gain a level, you can swap one of your signature items with another formula in your formula book. This new signature item must be on your research field’s list of possible signature items."</li>
<li>Page 75: Alchemical Alacrity lets you make three alchemical items, but you can't hold all three, so it's unclear what happens to the third one. Add to the end "and you automatically stow one of these new items as you create them."</li>
<li>Page 75: In perpetual infusions, "bullheaded mutagen" should say "serene mutagen."</li>
<li>Page 89: Raging Athlete. The wording has been adjusted to prevent unintended interactions with other abilities while keeping the same benefits. Change the text to "Physical obstacles can’t hold back your fury. While you are raging, you gain a climb Speed and swim Speed equal to your land Speed and the DC of High Jumps and Long Jumps decreases by 10. Your distance for a vertical Leap increases to 5 feet vertically, and your distance for a horizontal Leap increases to 15 feet if your Speed is at least 15 feet and to 20 feet if your Speed is at least 30 feet."</li>
<li>Page 91: Sudden Leap is missing the two-action icon from the fighter version, leaving the action cost unstated. Add in the two action icon.
Pages 99-103: Various bard feats shouldn't have the "focus pool" prerequisite. If you somehow take them without a focus pool (typically via multiclassing), you gain a focus pool, as normal for taking your first feat that grants a focus spell.</li>
<li>Pages 102, 201, 211: In Quickened Casting, change the restriction to "If your next action is to cast a <code>Classname</code> cantrip or a spell that is at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level <code>Classname</code> spell slot you have" inserting bard, sorcerer, or wizard as appropriate. This wording change makes it clear how to handle situations where you have a cantrip or focus spell at a different spell level than your highest spell slot.</li>
<li>Class Chapter (all spellcasting classes): Change the definition of cantrips to say "A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, which equals the highest-level of <code>Classname</code> spell slot you have." filling in the appropriate class name. This removes the ambiguities around the cantrip level of a non-spellcaster vs a multiclass spellcaster.</li>
<li>Pages 222-231: In the multiclass spellcaster Breadth feats, change "for each spell level other than your two highest spell levels" to "for each spell level other than your two highest <code>Classname</code> spell slots." inserting the appropriate class. This makes it clear what to do if you are a spellcaster multiclassing in another spellcasting class (or potentially multiclassing in multiple spellcasting classes).</li>
<li>Page 630: In curses, add "Effects with this trait can be removed only by effects that specifically target curses." This makes it clear that you need to use spells like remove curse to remove a curse, even one put in place by a spell, as opposed to dispel magic. </li>
<li>Pages 337, 403, 405: In feeblemind, celestial brand, and jealous hex, make it clear that they are applying a curse.</li>
<li>Page 634: Add the olfactory trait from the Bestiary to the Glossary and Index "An olfactory effect can affect only creatures that can smell it. This applies only to olfactory parts of the effect, as determined by the GM." </li>
<li>Pages 629–633: In the definitions of the chaotic, evil, good, and lawful traits, remove the last sentence. Creatures can use abilities of an alignment without matching that alignment, but they might be anathema or change a creature’s alignment over time with repeated use. </li>
<li>Page 637: In the definition of the summoned trait, add this section to deal with summoned creatures creating more creatures without using summoning "A summoned creature can't control any spawn or other creatures generated from it, and such creatures return to their unaltered state (usually a corpse in the case of spawn) once the summoned creature is gone. If it's unclear what this state would be, the GM decides."</li>

<ul>
<li>Page 113: The champion's Quick Block feat accidentally had a different name than fighter Quick Shield Block. Change the name to Quick Shield Block to make it clear this is the same feat in two different classes, much like Blind Fight, Quick Draw, or Sudden Charge. 
Additionally, the errata for the 2nd Printing from Blade of Justice correctly removed the restriction making the feat paladin-only but should have still kept a prerequisites of tenets of good. Add that prerequisite back. </li>
<li>Pages 118, 130, 204: In the wizard, change the spells you can select at 1st level to "You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list (page 307) or from other arcane spells you gain access to. " to match the witch.
The cleric and druid are slightly more complicated, as there was some confusion as to how clerics and druids learn new spells (they use Learn a Spell). Change cleric to say they prepare their spells "from the common spells on the divine spell list (page 309) or from other divine spells to which you gain access and learn via Learn a Spell." and druid to follow suit. This will cause clerics and druids to have an ever-expanding list of options, so if this becomes unmanageable compared to other prepared spellcasters, consider either restricting to a smaller and more manageable subset of spells like the other prepared spellcasters or implementing strategies like having a few default lists prepared in advance.</li>
<li>Pages 119-120: The 2nd printing errata accidentally missed the cleric when it came to giving expert proficiency in unarmed attacks. Add to both the cloistered cleric and warpriest doctrines that they gain expert proficiency in unarmed attacks in addition to their deity's favored weapon. They still only get the critical specialization effect for their deity's favored weapon.</li>
<li>Page 151: The Knockdown feat's wording made it ambiguous whether you were actually Tripping, which left it uncertain whether you apply any special effects and requirements related to the Trip action. To make it clear, change it to say "If you do and your Strike hits, instead of rolling a check for your Trip attempt, you automatically apply the critical success effect of a Trip." </li>
<li>Page 153: Fighter's Boundless Reprisals should specify you use the reactions for fighter reactions. At the end, add that you can use the extra reactions "for any reaction from a fighter feat or class feature."</li>
<li>Page 164: Monk's Mountain Quake doesn't list which DC to use. While it's technically fine not to include, as class DC is the default for a class feat, given that monks might also have a spell DC, most monk feats indicate that they use class DC. Change to "with a basic Fortitude save against your class DC." </li>
<li>Pages 165, 331, 391, 395, 402, 406, 407: Several auras were missing the aura trait. Add it to monk's Enlightened Presence feat and the divine aura, destructive aura, protector's sphere, angelic halo, dread aura, and protective ward spells</li>
<li>Page 174: The ranger camouflage feat's wording didn't explain what it was meant to do correctly and thus didn't work like camouflage and let you sneak around without any cover or concealment. Change the last sentence to "In natural terrain, you can Hide and Sneak even without cover or being concealed."</li>
<li>Page 177: Ranger's Impossible Volley was missing the flourish and open traits. Add them.</li>
<li>Page 181: Rogue's sneak attack accidentally left out ranged unarmed attacks, like leshy's seedpod. Change to "If you Strike a creature that has the flat-footed condition with an agile or finesse melee weapon, an agile or finesse unarmed attack, a ranged weapon attack, or a ranged unarmed attack, you deal an extra 1d6 precision damage. For a ranged attack with a thrown melee weapon, that weapon must also be agile or finesse."</li>
<li>Page 201: Sorcerer's Magic Sense should add the trait corresponding to the tradition of spells the sorcerer casts.</li>
<li>Page 205: The Drain Bonded Item is missing language indicating you need to have the item on your person, so add ", as long as the item is on your person." to the end of the first sentence.</li>
<li>Page 214, 217: Animal companions don't technically ever say they are animals, even though some later companions that aren't animals mention they have the "dragon trait instead of the animal trait" for instance. Therefore, change to say "Your animal companion has the animal and minion traits."
Secondly, the nimble animal companion had an error in converting from the playtest and should not have kept a higher proficiency with unarmored defense, which put it roughly 4 AC above other animal companions and in some cases higher than a PC can have. This is a carryover from when proficiency only gave +1 and the savage companion used to have higher proficiency in unarmed attacks while the nimble companion had higher in unarmored defense. Change it so it raises just Acrobatics to expert, putting it back in parallel with savage raising Athletics. This also adjusts Ambusher, Daredevil, and all similar specializations in other books that raise unarmored proficiency: in all those specializations, remove the part where it raises unarmored proficiency to master if the companion was nimble. </li>
<li>Page 216: The Horse companion's support benefit mistakenly used the word attack when it meant to use Strike. Change to read "Your horse adds momentum to your charge. Until the start of your next turn, if you moved at least 10 feet on the action before your Strike, add a circumstance bonus to damage for that Strike equal to twice the number of damage dice. If your weapon already has the jousting weapon trait, increase the trait’s damage bonus by 2 per die instead."</li>
<li>Page 231: The wizard multiclass archetype didn't let you pick a school with the dedication, meaning you have to take Arcane School Spell to get some wizard feats, unlike for instance sorcerer, bard, and druid, who choose a bloodline, muse, or order but gain no abilities. Change wizard dedication so you can choose an arcane school but gain no abilities from it. Then in Arcane School Spell, you don't choose a school, and you gain the school spell from the school you already chose.</li>
<li>Page 247: The Lore skill was ambiguous when addressing inappropriate choices of Lore as to whether those subcategories were allowed. Change to make it clear they are not: "For instance, you couldn't choose Magic Lore to recall the breadth of knowledge about magic covered by Arcana, Nature, Occultism, and Religion, or Adventuring Lore to give you all the information an adventurer needs, or Planar Lore to gain all the information spread across various skills and subcategories such as Heaven Lore."</li>
<li>Page 266: Scare to Death's kill chances wound up being too high compared to its action cost and other abilities. Change the critical success to say "The target must attempt at a Fortitude save against your Intimidation DC. On a critical failure, it dies. On any other result, it becomes frightened 2 and is fleeing for 1 round. The critical failure effect has the death trait." Then remove the death trait from the feat itself, as creatures immune to death effects can still take the other consequences.</li>
<li>Pages 301, 634, 637: The minion and summoned traits are out of date. Change to match Secrets of Magic. 
Minions are creatures that directly serve another creature. A creature with this trait can use only 2 actions per turn, doesn’t have reactions, and can’t act when it’s not your turn. Your minion acts on your turn in combat, once per turn, when you spend an action to issue it commands. For an animal companion, you Command an Animal; for a minion that’s a spell or magic item effect, like a summoned minion, you Sustain a Spell or Sustain an Activation; if not otherwise specified, you issue a verbal command as a single action with the auditory and concentrate traits. If given no commands, minions use no actions except to defend themselves or to escape obvious harm. If left unattended for long enough, typically 1 minute, mindless minions usually don’t act, animals follow their instincts, and sapient minions act how they please. A minion can’t control other creatures. 
A creature called by a spell or effect gains the summoned trait. A summoned creature can’t summon other creatures, create things of value, or cast spells that require a cost. It has the minion trait. If it tries to Cast a Spell of equal or higher level than the spell that summoned it, it overpowers the summoning magic, causing its own spell to fail and the summon spell to end. Otherwise, the summoned creature uses the standard abilities for a creature of its kind. It generally attacks your enemies to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with it, you can attempt to command it, but the GM determines the degree to which it follows your commands.
Immediately when you finish Casting the Spell, the summoned creature uses its 2 actions for that turn. A spawn or other creature generated from a summoned creature returns to its unaltered state (usually a corpse in the case of spawn) once the summoned creature is gone. If it’s unclear what this state would be, the GM decides. Summoned creatures can be banished by various spells and effects. They are automatically banished if reduced to 0 Hit Points or if the spell that called them ends. </li>
<li>Pages 316, 317, 318, 330, 332, 335, 347, 353, 354, 358: In aerial form, animal form, avatar, dinosaur form, dragon form, elemental form, insect form, monstrosity form, nature incarnate, plant form, change "only attacks you can use" to "only attacks you can Strike with." You can still use non-Strike attacks like Grapple and Trip as normal.
317, 352, 359, 385: In alter reality, miracle, primal phenomenon, and wish, the spells should be able to automatically duplicate spell slot spells (not rituals or focus spells), and only ones to which you have access in case your group was explicitly restricting access to certain spells for thematic reasons, difficulty of running the spells, or any other reason. Change the first two bullet points to read like the following, with wish as an example:
"• Duplicate any spell from the arcane list of 9th level or lower to which you have access.
• Duplicate any spell from another spell list of 7th level or lower to which you have access."</li>
<li>Page 324: Chromatic wall's blue wall stops sound and correctly indicated that it blocked auditory effects but failed to mention it blocked sonic effects too. Add sonic to the list of effects it blocks. This change also adjusts spells like prismatic wall that depend on chromatic wall.</li>
<li>Pages 326, 329, 333, 335, 348, 349, 360, 366, 369, 371, 373: A number of spells accidentally had a duration of 24 hours or 1 day instead of "until the next time you make your daily preparations." In general, nearly all beneficial spells should have the latter duration so you can check and keep them active each morning, so that for instance your awesome mansion doesn't vanish and spit out the guests once a day until you make another. These are contingency, dimensional lock, dream message, energy aegis, lock, magnificent mansion, private sanctum, sanctified ground, shrink item, spell immunity, and status.</li>
<li>Page 330: Disintegrate technically didn't mention what to do on a hit or miss with the spell attack roll. Add "On a hit" before "you deal 12d10 damage" to make it clear you need to hit.</li>
<li>Page 340, 369, 562, 574: In the last errata document, we removed some of the restrictions on spells like magic weapon requiring you cast them on a nonmagical weapon, but we missed a few. In ghostly weapon and shillelagh, change the target to remove the requirement that it's nonmagical. This requires an extra line in ghostly weapon to explain what happens if you already have the maximum number of property runes for a magical weapon. "If the weapon is magical and already has the maximum number of property runes, the wielder can choose one to suppress to gain ghost touch." Then change the items primeval mistletoe and oil of potency as well to remove the restriction, as they mimic effects of these kinds of spells.</li>
<li>Page 351: In meteor swarm, there is some ambiguity on how the multiple meteors work when dealing with larger creatures. To make it clear, change the text to say "The meteors’ central 10-foot bursts can’t overlap, and a creature attempts only one saving throw against the spell no matter how many overlapping explosions it's caught in, and they can take each type of damage once once."</li>
<li>Page 356: Pest form has a couple of errors. First, increase the land Speed it grants to 20 feet, as 10 feet is too slow to effectively scout while appearing to be a normal animal. Second, unlike other battle forms, it lacks the text directly explaining what to do about Strikes. Pest form is a 1st level scouting spell and is not meant for attacking, so explicitly change to "While in this form, you gain the animal trait, and you can’t make Strikes." </li>
<li>Page 376: In synaptic pulse, remove the extraneous range listing, and change the second sentence to say "Each enemy in the area must attempt a Will save." to match the first sentence.</li>
<li>Page 387: Both inspire heroics and lingering composition should have the metamagic trait. Add it to both focus spells.</li>
<li>Page 405: Undeath's Blessing's Failure effect was inconsistent with the Success effect. The Failure effect (or effect for those who choose to forego the save) should be "For the duration, harm and heal spells treat the creature as undead. In addition, harm spells gain a +2 status bonus to the Hit Points restored to the target." </li>
<li>Page 446: While there are numerous places in the Core Rulebook that indicate that non-Strike attack actions like Shove and Trip take a multiple attack penalty on their checks, in one spot in the definition of multiple attack penalty, it mentions that you take your multiple attack penalty on attack rolls. This caused some confusion as to whether it applies to skill checks or other rolls you might make as part of an attack action despite the other references, so to clear that up, change "attack roll" to "check" in both places.</li>
<li>Page 451, 621: There are a lot of questions about persistent damage. Check the CRB FAQ for more information, but the one thing that we're adding in errata is explicitly stating " Like normal damage, it can be doubled or halved based on the results of an attack roll or saving throw."</li>
<li>Page 476: Flanking was ambiguous on what happened if you made a ranged attack while within reach of a foe you are flanking. To make it clear that only melee attacks benefit from flanking, change the second sentence to read "A creature is flat-footed (taking a –2 circumstance penalty to AC) to melee attacks from creatures that are flanking it."</li>
<li>Page 500: Since people have been specifically asking about Assurance with respect to downtime, after "If something could apply constantly, or so often that it might as well be constant, it’s more likely to be used for downtime checks;" we added "for instance Assurance could apply." to show that it's something that could apply constantly.</li>
<li>Page 557: Electric eelskin armor accidentally listed a spell DC for shocking grasp and not a spell attack modifier. It should have a spell attack modifier of +19.</li>
<li>Page 557, 600: Specific magic armor and weapons say you can't etch a property rune, but you also can't remove a property rune or transfer a property rune to or from a specific armor or weapon. Explicitly add those restrictions to the definitions of each.</li>
<li>Page 565: The intro to Affixing a Talisman said you can't affix more than one talisman to the same item, which is slightly incorrect. Change it to match the Affix a Talisman action just below, which says you can, but you just deactivate them all so it's usually a bad idea. </li>
<li>Pages 565, 597: You only need to learn a single 1st level formula to Craft any scroll or any magic wand (though specialty wands each require their own formulas as normal). Add "You only need to learn one 1st-level formula to Craft a magic wand." and parallel text for scrolls.</li>
<li>Page 585: In the wounding rune, given that persistent damage doubles on a critical hit, changing the 1d6 to 1d12 instead of doubling would actually make it deal less damage on average. Thus, remove the part about changing to 1d12 damage on a critical hit. Instead, the wounding rune's bleed damage doubles as normal for persistent damage.</li>
<li>Page 588: Reflecting shield's counteract modifier had a typo listing it at +40. It should be +30.</li>
<li>Page 614: The ring of lies was erroneously missing its frequency entry for the activation. It should be once per day, as per the usual guidelines for a spell activation in an item.</li>
<li>Page 614: The greater ring of maniacal devices has a price that is drastically incorrect for a level 18 item. It should be 21,000 gp. The incorrect price is also listed in the treasure tables.</li>
<li>Page 616: Replace robe of the archmagi's color scheme with a more in-world pattern using gold for good, red for evil, and light blue for neutral. This scheme is patterned after gold dragons (the strongest metallic dragon), red dragons (the strongest chromatic dragon), and cloud dragons (the strongest, and all true neutral primal dragon) respectively.</li>

This includes the witch feat Siphon Power, the Quickened Casting feat in both oracle and witch (which standardizes it with the same change in the Core Rulebook Quickened Casting feats) and candle of invocation.</li>
<li>Page 95: In witch initial proficiencies, the spell proficiencies say the tradition of magic is determined by the witch's first lesson, but that's a holdover from the playtest. It should say the tradition is determined by the witch's patron.</li>
<li>Page 101: Witch's Widen Spell accidentally had the concentrate trait instead of manipulate like everyone else. Change it to manipulate.</li>
<li>Page 111: In Sunder Spell, there's no guidance on what it takes to hit something like a wall that doesn't have a listed AC. Add "“If you're targeting something that doesn't have an AC listed, its AC is usually 10 against this Strike for targets that are very easy to hit, like a wall, or a different AC determined by the GM.”</li>
<li>Page 146: There's been some confusion over whether an independent familiar can use abilities that require a command, like valet, or whether the independent ability overrides the normal rules for mounted combat. To make clear that neither is the case, add "This doesn’t work with valet or similar abilities that require a command, if you’re capable of riding your familiar, or similar situations."</li>
<li>Page 161: Beastmaster's Call was missing its school. It should be conjuration.</li>
<li>Page 163: In bounty hunter's Keep Pace, in the first sentence, the word "escape" should not be capitalized. It's just talking about escaping in general, not the Escape action.</li>

<li>Page 168-169: Dragon disciple has a couple errors. First, the dedication feat should make you trained in arcane spell DCs and spell attack rolls, in case you need that training when picking up the later feats that give you arcane focus spells. Second, the armor bonus from Scales of the Dragon feat should change to match the errata to Animal Skin and Mountain Stance in the Core Rulebook. The final text of that section is as follows: "When you’re unarmored, the scales give you a +2 item bonus to AC with a Dexterity cap of +3. The item bonus to AC from Scales of the Dragon is cumulative with armor potency runes on your explorer's clothing, mage armor, and bracers of armor."</li>
<li>Page 172: Remove the paragraph from the first printing that begins, "If you already cast spells from spell slots, you gain one additional cantrip from that tradition." If you're already a spellcaster, you use your normal allotment of spells for eldritch archer abilities and don't gain more spells.</li>
<li>Page 191: Sentinel Archetype's Armor Specialist feat had a stray Skill trait due to an error. Remove it.</li>

<li>Page 214, 222, 223, 228, 232, 237: Animated assault, mad monkeys, quench, hymn of healing, interstellar void, and steal shadow all need to say their effects occur "The first time each round you Sustain the Spell" due to clarifications in the Core Rulebook on Sustaining spells. Meanwhile, aqueous orb is in the opposite situation because it was meant to allow effects from multiple Sustains already. Remove "Unlike most spells"</li>
<li>Page 220-221: Ice storm and lightning storm had some issues, with potentially-intense effects limited to a way-too-small area. The big change was that they both updated the area from 5-foot radius to 20-foot radius, but there's a few adjustments to keep them on track with other similar spells with the new area. The full adjusted text is as follows:</li>
<li>Ice Storm<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ice Storm Spell 4</strong> <br />
    Cold Evocation<br />
    Traditions arcane, primal<br />
    Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal<br />
    Range 120 feet; Area 20-foot burst<br />
    Saving Throw basic Reflex; Duration sustained up to 1 minute<br />
    You create a gray storm cloud that pelts creatures with an icy deluge. When you Cast the Spell, a burst of magical hail deals 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 2d8 cold damage to each creature in the area below the cloud (basic Reflex save). Snow and sleet continue to rain down in the area for the remainder of the spell’s duration, making the area difficult terrain. Any creature that ends its turn in the storm takes 2 cold damage. If you Cast this Spell outdoors, you can create two non-overlapping clouds instead of one. As normal, if a big creature is in both clouds, it still only takes the initial damage once and the continuing damage once per turn.<br />
<strong>Heightened</strong> (+2) The initial bludgeoning damage and cold damage increase by 1d8 each, and the cold damage creatures take at the end of their turns increases by 1.  </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lightning Storm</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>**Lightning Storm Spell 5</strong> <br />
    Electricity Evocation<br />
    Traditions primal<br />
    Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal<br />
    Range 120 feet; Area 20-foot burst<br />
    Saving Throw basic Reflex; Duration sustained up to 1 minute<br />
    You create a black, rumbling storm cloud and call down one lightning bolt within the spell’s area. The bolt is a vertical line from the top of the storm cloud to the ground below, dealing 4d12 electricity damage to creatures in the line (basic Reflex save). On subsequent rounds, the first time you Sustain the Spell each round, you can call another lightning bolt within the area. If you Cast this Spell outdoors, you can create two non-overlapping clouds instead of one, though you can still call down only one bolt per turn. <br />
    Heightened (+2) The damage of each bolt increases by 1d12.  </p>

<li>Page 230: Ancestral form says you can "Sustain a Spell" but should say you can "Sustain Spells" to make it clearer that you are not limited to Sustaining a single spell.</li>
<li>Page 233: Tempest form prevents you from using manipulate actions but then offers several you can do. Add "except those granted by this spell" to the restriction on manipulate actions.</li>
<li>Page 234: Heal companion's 2-action version was missing the somatic component. It should have both somatic and verbal components.</li>
<li>Page 248: The ranged weapons had slight errors in their table entries. The bola should be an uncommon weapon. Meanwhile, the daikyu should have reload 0 (not --) and should be propulsive.</li>
<li>Page 249: Detective's Kit, like the Core Rulebook kits, should need 1 hand if you're wearing it and 2 otherwise. Change to match Core Rulebook.</li>

<li>Page 265: Wand of hopeless night's 4th-level spell type should increase the DC to 27.</li>

Curses are always magical and are typically the result of a spell or trap. Effects with this trait can be removed only by effects that specifically target curses. 457–458"</li>
<li>Page 268-270: As mentioned in the Bestiary 2 errata, there were some small changes to the minion and summoned traits to better handle situations where minions might get control of more creatures and create a cascade. In the minion trait, at the end add "A minion can’t control other creatures." In the summoned trait, remove the specification that the spell summoning them must be conjuration (as some necromancy spells summon creatures, for instance), and remove the sentence saying they can't control any spawn they create, since the minion trait now already includes that restriction and it's redundant to include it again in summoned.</li>

<li>Page 34: The basidirond’s hallucinogenic cloud is missing all its traits. These should be incapacitation, mental, and poison.</li>
<li>Page 57: The culdewen should be uncommon, and several abilities didn't work quite right, making it unnecessarily difficult for PCs to escape the culdewen's hook. Add the uncommon trait. In Hooked, change “The fish hook can be removed only if a creature spends an Interact action and succeeds at a DC 25 Athletics check to pull it free.” to “The fish hook can be removed if a creature Escapes (DC 25), pulling it free. In Land the Fish, after “On a success, the creature is restrained by the culdewen.” add “Escaping from the restrained condition (DC 25) also allows a creature to remove the hook.</li>

If the target wasn’t already frightened, they must immediately attempt a DC 33 Will save against the thanadaemon's terrifying gaze. If the target was already frightened, they must attempt a DC 33 Will save or become fleeing for 1d4 rounds; this second effect has the incapacitation trait. After attempting its save, the creature is temporarily immune to this ability until the start of the thanadaemon's next turn.”</li>

<li>Replace it with:<blockquote>
<p><strong>Spectral Corruption [two-actions]</strong> (curse, divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental) 
  The specter makes a vile touch Strike. If it damages a living creature, the specter gains 5 temporary Hit Points and the target creature must attempt a DC 24 Will save to avoid becoming corrupted. 
  Critical Success The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune to spectral corruption for 1 minute. 
  Success The creature is stupefied 2 for 1 hour. 
  Failure The creature succumbs to the corruption and becomes a spectral thrall temporarily. The creature is controlled by the specter, obeying the specter's telepathic or spoken orders, though a spectral thrall does not obey obviously self-destructive orders. This lasts until the end of the thrall’s next turn, at which point it is no longer controlled but becomes stupefied 2 for 1 hour.<br />
  Critical Failure As failure, but the duration is unlimited. The thrall can attempt a new Will save at the end of each of its turns; on a success, it is no longer controlled by the specter but becomes stupefied 2 for 1 hour.  </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Change the vile touch Strike to “vile touch +16 (finesse), Damage 2d8+8 negative.” Note that this also cuts "plus spectral corruption" from the Strike, since it needs to use the Spectral Corruption activity to get the full effect.</li>
<li>As a note for summoning specters, an upcoming erratum to the minion trait in the Core Rulebook will clarify that minions can't control other creatures, which means summoned specters can't control other creatures with Spectral Corruption.</li>

<li>Second, change the failure and critical failure entries to:<blockquote>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is fascinated. For as long as it is fascinated, it must spend each of its actions to move closer to the yellow musk creeper as expediently as possible, while avoiding obvious dangers. If the creature is adjacent to the yellow musk creeper, it stays still and doesn't act. If anyone takes a hostile action against the creature or its allies, the effect ends. Otherwise, the creature can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the effects end.<br />
<strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the condition doesn't end automatically if anyone takes a hostile action against the creature or its allies.</p>
